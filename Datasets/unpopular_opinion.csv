Eating cereal with water is better than with milk,"I am a true believer that cereal with water is better. The taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. While still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. My friends crucified me when I told them this...so for this reason I am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. 

Edit: I pour the cereal before the water, for those asking

Reddit not covering the Sri Lanka bombings the same way it covered the New Zealand shootings is dirty politics.,"The 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few Muslims. They carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

Evil is evil. Stop blocking breaking news.






Edit: I would like to clarify. 
I am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-Christian, or anti/pro Islam.

I am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, I had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as Notre Dame or New Zealand massacres. 

I don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case Muslims. It could have been extremist Christians and I would say the same thing about them. 

Humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. Stop the violence and protect the planet. Why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",unpopularopinion
Amy Schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail [see below],"EDIT: Thanks for the awards. I hope this post can raise some awareness.

In a [speech Schumer gave](https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  Ms. Foundation for Women’s Gloria Awards and Gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""And then came the sex, and I use that word very loosely. His penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". Sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

Amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. In this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UrhXqRq2_4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=480), Amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. The host says ""so you raped a guy"" at [11:12](https://youtu.be/8UrhXqRq2_4?t=670) and Amy replies ""yeah I know. When I tell this story I say I let a cab driver finger me but really I took his hand...\[sic\]"". If the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this TWICE, he'd be in jail after public outrage. Why the double standards.

Being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but I don't have a rally cry of support behind me,"My ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. 

Anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent. 


Edit 2 - Well this blew up. I'd like to say that I really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. Thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. To those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why I put this in unpopular opinions. Not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

As has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. Sometimes its hard. Just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody.

I'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous,"Like if you like to be called ""Daddy"" in bed it's a bit Freudian, weird maybe, but I don't mind, you know? If you wanna be tied up, be tied up. Have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, I don't mind at all. 

But if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

In a lot of children's shows like Peppa Pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids,"Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. The girls save the day. I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile ""Mommy Pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.

From an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? Like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",unpopularopinion

Cardi B Drugging And Robbing Men Makes Her a Predator,"In a recently discovered online video, Cardi B claims “I had to go strip, I had to go, ‘Oh yeah, you want to fuck me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go back to this hotel,’ and I drugged niggas up, and I robbed them. That’s what I used to do. "" 

That is the work of a predator. Maybe it isn't as bad as Bill Cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. Cardi B should not be a celebrated public figure.

As a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. If you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less. 

How many of those men overdosed from the drugs and never made it out of the hotel room? We will never know.

Thanking God for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.,"I'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but I've seen enough posts and comments online. I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude). Also, I gotta be that person as I don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",unpopularopinion
Preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money,"Every fucking time I buy a frozen pizza, I put that sassy bitch in right when I start the oven. Why? Because I’ve figured it out. That’s right Uncle Sam, I’m onto you. 

The directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425F and cook for 15 minutes. My oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. So, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? No way. Not chance in hell, buckaroo. When I shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, I add 3-4 minutes to compensate. This means I wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. And guess what? It tastes fucking delicious. Ask any of my friends. I cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can’t get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. The pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. Source: I’ve been doing this for 12 years.

So nice try, Mr. President. I know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. Maybe it isn’t significant if one person cooks their frozen Italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you’re a thinker. You’re looking at the grand  scheme of things.

"If your first language is English, you have no excuse for not being able to distinguish between “there”, “their”, and “they’re”.","The same goes for “your” vs. “you’re” (and also “two”, “too”, and “to”). These words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy. 

I feel like telling people (politely) when they’ve used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying “language is fluid” isn’t appropriate for such a serious mistake. I think it’s fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong “there” actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"We spend TOO much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.","I get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and I am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.

"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.","There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

Traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven’t traveled,"I’ve traveled everywhere. The UK, Germany, France, India, Bangladesh, about half of the US (including California, Las Vegas, New York, Minneapolis, Tennessee, Hawaii, you get the idea) 

Not once have I ever felt “yeah, I’m experiencing something I couldn’t back at home”

When you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

I’ve hiked on mountains, I’ve swam in oceans, Ive been on the London eye, I’ve run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have I felt “yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away”

And I’m not some anti social weirdo, I go out of my way to interact with other people. Nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. Yeah sure there are differences, but they aren’t interesting. A quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major “””””””””culture shocks””””””””””” anyway. 

You wanna know my favorite part of traveling? The fucking trip. The plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. Unironically this is my favorite part because I get to fucking sleep

Whenever someone says they love traveling I immediately think they either haven’t traveled much or they are just so god damn boring they find entertainment by fucking moving the ground under their feet",unpopularopinion
The most underrepresented/oppressed group in america isnt black/hispanic/gays/bi/etc.. It's native americans.,"Its so true that history is written by the winners. If germany was won by hitler, they would treat holocaust EXACTLY the same as how people treat native american killing now

 It bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as ""good"" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

Seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in ""reserves"" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land? 

People say japanese are adamant about not apologizing for what happened in wwii; what about americans to native americans?

People say there arent many female millonaires/leaders. What about native americans?

Baby Boomers are the most entitled generation in US history.,"I know we have all heard and seen all the hatred on “snowflake millennials and generation z,” coming from baby boomers, but it’s completely unwarranted.

Boomers grew up right after WW2, which left them with an amazing economy and immense opportunity. People were able to afford a new car, a house and college from their full time jobs in their early 20s, which is why we catch all of this “well back when I was your age” bullshit. They were all able to keep stable jobs for 30 plus years, collect a good pension and collect social security and invest loads of money into flourishing assets and on top of it all, have a hearty savings built up, all while having a 4 year degree. We catch so much shit from boomers, because literally none of them understand how disgustingly bad inflation is right now, compared to when they were growing up. I remember having conversations with my grandparents, talking about how they bought a brand new corvette for 3,500 dollars, paid off their 30,000 dollar house and already had 30,000 in savings before they even turned 30, and neither of them graduated high school. Meanwhile, millennials are going to school for 6 years for bio mechanical engineering and then working as a fucking barista at minimum wage waiting for a job. Buying a car less than 10 years old costs anywhere from 12,000-20,000 dollars, let alone the gas prices, fees and taxes that we pay. Then, they live at a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other people doing almost exactly the same thing, and they all live on ramen noodles and shit. Our student debt reaches up to 130,000 depending on what kind of career we want, which all take us the rest of our lives to pay off, assuming we even get the job we paid to be qualified in. To make things worse, we have all of these young adults saying shit to appease the boomers like “I was born in the generation of pussies” or some shit like that. It’s disgusting to hear and see all the hatred we get from a generation who had their entire life given to them on a silver platter while we struggle to survive independently.

"If Tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.","Tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""You go girl!"", ""Girl power!"", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""Asshole!"", ""So misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9""** 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

Claiming I'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually WORSE because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

Being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

Go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

&gt;its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

&gt;also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

&gt;should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

&gt;society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

For anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

&gt;I live in aus and about 11 years ago I used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with America, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the US for one summer. She went over there an had an inappropriate ‘romance’ with a camp attendee. He was 15 and she was 20. The boys parents found out and had her charged. She went to a women’s prison in Iowa. Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home. She is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. She is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. She is banned from ever travelling to the US. IMO she got what she deserved.

Alcohol is overrated and drinking in General is not that fun.,"I personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me I personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. I never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am I missing something ?

And before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends I doubt that since I have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. Hes probably part of the reason I dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

The death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.,"Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

Alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn’t have the social acceptance it does.,"Alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I’ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don’t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify I don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly.

Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself.

Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",unpopularopinion
"I don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.","Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

&gt;That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&amp;#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",unpopularopinion

"If we should blame anyone for the lack of action on Climate Change, it should be Greenpeace.","Because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. They are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

Swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.,"When you swim in denim jeans it’s like you’re an armored aquatic creature. The way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. Feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they’re soaking wet.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men","It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",unpopularopinion

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",unpopularopinion

My sister's father died 'cause the parents of his only potential heart donor were religious and said ""nope you can't go to heaven without all your organs so yea he can die I want to go to heaven duh"", how much I hope their cause of death implies losing an organ and be conscious long enough to realize they're not going to heaven

Fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick,"I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. I'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but I'm well inside the 'normal' BMI range (BMI of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations.

It’s fine to not like them, it’s fine to not want to be around them, and it’s certainly fine to not want to have them.

What some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. Constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. Even if you’re not saying it to their face, even if they’re too young to even understand you — you’re just an asshole. 

Also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. They have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. They are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. And just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

I’m just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren’t people yet, like they’re less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. It’s so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.

Life would be better without sexual desire,"Sex make life a lot more complicated than it has to be, and ultimately sex is more trouble than it is worth. 

Sex makes people objectify others, hate others for their sexual orientation, and act irrationally. The most intimate moments between two people should be during a conversation, not when one is slamming into the other. Two people can be driven apart by sexual incompatibility even if everything else checks out.

If humans did not have an overwhelming compulsion to have sex, mankind would be much better off. And it's unfortunate that they do.

EDIT: 

I'm seeing a lot of two particular comments, and I'd like to address them because they are repetitive and make untrue assumptions. 

 **There would be no people without sexual desire** 

That might have been true in the Stone Age, but we have IVF now if you don't want to do the act. Perhaps the birth rate would go down if people suddenly had no desire to have sex tomorrow, but that would also eliminate almost all unwanted children. At any rate, my suggestion is that it would be better (as some has figured out) if people evolved beyond having to reproduce because of sexual desire. Obviously, if we rewind human history to its origins, there would be no people without sexual desire, and I will concede that.

 **Sex is responsible for the closeness between couples**

I don't deny that sex can make two people close because of the hormones involved, but I don't think that makes sexual desire worth it when you consider the negatives I mentioned. Plato believed that love between brothers was more sincere than the love between sexual partners because it was there without lust, and I agree with that.

EDIT 2: 

I've noticed a third item that should also be addressed.

**The motivation of men to do anything is so they can get laid**

There are probably thousands of counterexamples to this, but the first one that comes to mind is the work of Michelangelo, This is a gay guy who never allowed himself to have sex or really any physically intimate contact with other men. One of the greatest artists of all time, despite the fact that he obviously wasn't working toward the goal of getting laid, because that was never on the table for him.",unpopularopinion

I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/NotTheOnion, r/TIFU, r/ELI5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all.

"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.","Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is.

The problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.,"Negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

This happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

Unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

This is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

I would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

We need to let some pet breeds die out.,"We have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

I don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades.

More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

It's ok to be weird. It's ok to be offensive. It's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. Just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. Because you are odd.

"If you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide","It's the same concept IMO. For women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. I think the same concept should apply to suicide. If someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. It's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (Shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). Obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

Edit: 

A lot of people are agreeing and saying ""I agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" My entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

That's like saying only rape victims or medically vulnerable mothers should be allowed to get abortions. Anyone should have access to a safe and reliable method of suicide, regardless of why they're doing it.",unpopularopinion

"Marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.","You've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the U.S. end in divorce. You've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
This is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. The reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of Disney fairytale. What a joke. But this is really ingrained in our culture. Think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. They take commitment. They take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

What does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*It means... not scrolling through the Facebook or IG pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. Saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if I was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*It means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""She/he was mean to me."" ""I deserve this."" ""She doesnt love me anyway. I can sleep with someone else now."" - Nope. you made a commitment. Stick by it and work on your issues.

\*It means... putting down the video games, the TV controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*It means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples of things I see so often that kill marriages. The truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",unpopularopinion
John Lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.,"He was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  Lennon resented his son Julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. After Lennon divorced his wife, he took off with Yoko Ono and dropped out of his son’s life for years. Julian has stated that Paul McCartney was far more of a father to him than John ever was. 

John was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in Liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. He often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. He claimed to have met Yoko Ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, Ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

John claimed to have lost interest in the Beatles due to Paul McCartney’s tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. Together, he and Yoko  destroyed the Beatles, then he blamed the breakup on Paul McCartney. 

He was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the Black Panthers.

He was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
His song writing was no better;  The lyrics to Strawberry Fields Forever and Come Together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

Lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as I say, not as I do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. All you have to do is look at his songs. Lennon, who sang Imagine no Possessions lived a millionaire’s life in a posh New York hotel.  Lennon sang Imagine no Religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and New Age fad that came along, including Hindu meditation, the I-Ching, and astrology of all kinds.  And it was Lennon who sang All you need is Love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. And it was Lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

"Assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist","Basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
BUT:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way

I’m tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from “woke” POC and LGBTQ+ communities,"I’m a pansexual black/Cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. Throughout these 5 years I’ve seen so many people who swore they were “woke” proceed to do a poem that isn’t much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. At the end of these poems, most POC go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they’ve done nothing but try to be an ally. 

This kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  A person of color can post anything about white people. They can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying “I hate white people” and be fine. Same thing with queer people and straight people. 

And I get it. I’m Black, Cuban, queer, and a woman. I’m made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. My gender has been put down for centuries. I would’ve had to force myself into the closet if I was born a couple of centuries earlier. I know what it’s like to be hated for who I am. I know what it’s like to feel angry for what’s been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. But I don’t compliment these poems. I don’t applaud. I don’t like these posts. Because it’s wrong. This is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. This is all just tit for tat. 

You’re not woke if you:

- Make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can’t take it back in your direction. 

-Use generalizations like “all white people” or “all straight people” but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like “all black people” or “all queer people. 

-Refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they’re a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn’t want to interact with you because you’re a queer person of color. 

-Push allies away when they’re trying to help you. 

-Think you’re better than anyone because of your identity. 

Everyone has the right to be who they want. To be proud of their identity. You have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn’t be hated and put down for it. But you shouldn’t put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

Next time you write a status or a poem about the “other” side, insert blanks on every time you name them. Insert something represents you into the blanks. Then read the poem and visualize someone from the “other” side reading it back to you. Do you feel put down? That’s what you’re doing to others. 


TLDR: Love yourself but don’t put other people down in the process.

Schools should not punish bullied kids for fighting back.,"If a kid gets physically hurt by a bully, I believe defending oneself should be allowed, since a slap on the wrist/detention will do almost nothing to make the bully ""see the light"" in his wrongdoings. A lot of people tend to disagree with this calling it barbaric, but why should a provoked kid who kept to himself be punished if he's reacting to what happened? Also, the school's way of punishing a bully tends to be very counterproductive in general.

A 'dislike' button on Facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better,"The title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but I do believe this to be true. The absence of a dislike button on Facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and I believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


The only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an Angry emoji or comment. The angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. Commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. Giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


Imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? You might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. This sends out the wrong message. This tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. Add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


It would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, I think it is IMPORTANT.

Accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty.,"With the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. As the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

Naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. Obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. However with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence.

Movies are better with subtitles.,"I know what you’re all thinking, “oh my god he likes subtitles? he probably supports dog fighting too!”

Yes I like subtitles. They are minimally intrusive and allow for a better understanding of he dialogue.

With subtitles, I never worry about this struggle. I always know exactly what they said. I’ve always been a big fan of well done character development, and dialogue is central to that.

The gays taking the rainbow to represent their movement was a dick move,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m completely supportive of the gays.

The rainbow should belong to everyone. It represents color and art. It represents a beautiful and near-magical natural phenomenon. 

It was a dick move to take a symbol that had meaning to everyone and limit it to representing who you’d rather fuck or date. 

People used to display the rainbow freely because it’s a beautiful thing— on clothes, on designs; I even remember an airplane company with a rainbow tail. Now whenever it’s displayed, it’s associated with a political movement.

Unattractive people should learn to accept that they’re not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,"“Everybody is beautiful to somebody.” 

“Ugly doesn’t exist.” 

“Everybody is equally attractive in their own way.” 

“Looks don’t even matter. What’s on the inside determines whether you’re attractive or not.”

These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It’s like everyone needs to believe they’re attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person’s only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn’t fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that’s nobody’s fault, but that’s just the way it is. 

Before you say “beauty is subjective”, you can’t deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I’ve yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder “what am I doing wrong?” when they find that others don’t view them how they view themselves.",unpopularopinion

Sending food to countries that can’t feed themselves only makes the problem worse. The root of the problem is these people can’t feed themselves. Feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can’t be fed. Either teach these people to farm or let them starve. If they aren’t capable of farming, survival of the fittest.

"Dear humans: Vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". It *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that.

This made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. But it's not.

It really doesn't help that in the U.S., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""American cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.)

"Telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not WHY we are really afraid.","Anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the Kavanaugh hearings. Resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

The conversation went as such: If you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. Furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

Yeah. No shit. The reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **OR** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). So... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

What ISN'T outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. The implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* In effect, it was a lie by omission. 

And the above really isn't my point anyways. Here's the main point:

*In a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. There are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

So, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* Where's the deterrent there? 

Another question that I have never once seen given a good answer:

How does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? This is how *most* consent occurs anyways. Other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? Throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: Intimacy with a Woman. 

We have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

Lastly: I want to be wrong. 

Here's what you can do if I am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard I've found. 

I'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that I am *nowhere close* to being alone here. Relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. You won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on Facebook. Talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on Reddit at least.  

So, if I am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that I am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"If your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.","For the record, I'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

What I am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. She had no negative feelings about it).

&amp;#x200B;

There are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&amp;#x200B;

The first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. He is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. I know, crazy right?

&amp;#x200B;

The second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. You are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. Does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&amp;#x200B;

1. No guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. I'm not saying that a guy should say ""Do this for me, or I'm leaving."" I'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. That relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. This obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, I only picked men and sex because I tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. Obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. If both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then I guess it's a match made in heaven.

This even goes for “younger” patients. The guy with the chronic liver disease or a drug user. In the “old days” those patients would’ve just died before receiving hundreds of thousands in medical care but now with so much advances in technology, people are kept alive much longer artificially than otherwise would’ve been.

"Schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.","You have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. So many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. Acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. I had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and I had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until I cried so I was forced to give up, not to mention that was a HUGE expense every month some families might not be able to spare. Different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. Turns out I didn't even have acne. I have a very common condition called KP, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. Eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. If you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. I could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

Weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. Their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. These kids essentially have an addiction. The majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. Bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. Also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine BMI and extremely healthy. Not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

I knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. Same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

All in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. I'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. Did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? It is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. Did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? We often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"It should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services.","Some may claim this isn’t unpopular, but I think it is. Bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman’s body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can’t even file a CPS report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

If you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. It should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she’s growing a developing fetus. 

It should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. At the very least, CPS should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

Edit: For those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you’re pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. This applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. Common sense would still be applied by CPS.",unpopularopinion

The word “retarded” shouldn’t be offensive,"The fact that society is shying away from “the r-word” is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. Basically, by replacing “retarded” with something else, we’re just kicking the can down the road and it’s a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

Not that long ago, the term “retarded” was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like “idiot” and “imbecile” (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

The term “special” or “special needs” is probably the most common way of replacing “retarded,” but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives “special snowflakes”).

Through crude antics and exaggerated perspectives they actually manage to say something substantial.

If your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.,"IMO a Dr or teacher should be able to contact CPS for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

Last night I saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. It broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

I don't know their circumstances and for the most part, I am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. However, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). A child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

These poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

Edit: Thank you for mentioning the factors I naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. These points are very valid and make a lot of sense. Perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

I had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

As anyone, I am speaking from my own experience and I did come from a family who struggled with money. I don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 I think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. My Doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. I have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

Edit 2: I remembered more of our eating habits as a child. We had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. We also spent a lot of time outside. All in all, EDUCATION is a huge influencer and EFFORT makes a difference!

"Reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.","Hear me out.

I originally came here because I heard that Reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. That was a lie.

Subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

The problem with the rules and independent moderation of Reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

Generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. It doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. Worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

Most moderators just want safe spaces. They usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

All of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use Reddit are. (Being liberal is okay, I'm a moderate, so I don't really care). Both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. I've seen conservatives do it too. Just not as much. Sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

The icing on the cake is that Reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

Reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. I have faith in time it will die.

Censorship will kill Reddit.

Safe spaces will kill Reddit. 

Cancerous moderation will kill Reddit.

Admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill Reddit.


Edit: By ""Moderate"" I'm saying that I'm in the middle, I base my political beliefs on what I think is right, and I don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. Both have great and terrible beliefs. I go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. I'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. I'm just clearing that up.",unpopularopinion

There are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing.

There’s guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they’d probably give them unrelenting shit.

If two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped,"I see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. If two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? The logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? I will never understand this or accept it. I agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. Reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. I cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

Edit: I've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things I think I should clarify. I absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. I have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw.

Even then I knew something was wrong with that picture. 

So now I'm older and realize that getting babies ears pierced is really fucked up. The baby can't even say yes or no to wanting their ears pierced. We all throw a fit when someone can't consent to something these days, so really why is this allowed? 

I've met people who had this happen and they didn't like the idea of piercings, but still had the holes in their ears from it. I got mine done years ago and I never wear earrings, but the holes are still there. I don't regret it, but I can't imagine how people feel that they got their ears pierced against their will when they couldn't even understand the meaning behind it. 

Anytime I bring this up it's an ""you're overreacting"" or ""it's not your child, why do you care?"" I feel like I'm going insane here, but how is this okay. How is piercing a baby who can't even understand what pierced ears are okay?",unpopularopinion

Jesus Fucking Christ, can we please start upvoting actual UNPOPULAR OPINIONS? Every time I come onto here it's always the same 5 opinions on the top that have been posted thousands of times already. This sub is more [r/politicalcirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalcirclejerk) or [r/personalopinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalopinion) more than anything. I gurantee any time you come onto here at least 2-3 of the above opinions are at the top.

It's like anything on this sub that isn't a popular/""non spoken majority opinion"" is downvoted into oblivion because people don't understand how the upvote/downvote button works on this sub. Don't get me wrong, I agree with about 90% of the opinions above but they're just overused and annoying by this point.

It is extremely rare to see an actual unpopular opinion get upvoted on here because people only upvote what they agree with, and ones that are actually unpopular get flooded with downvotes and removed. I have definitely seen a few unpopular opinions hit the top or get a lot of upvotes (cereal with water, eating shit is ok, I love eating frozen dinners frozen) but it's very rare.

**Some Unpopular Opinions I have:**

\-New Jersey is a great state, probably one of the best northern states. Stop thinking of ""Jersey Shore"" because the majority of this state is working class families living in the suburbs, not party freaks and Tony Soprano wannabes.

\-Boomers and Gen X were entitled but get too much hate in terms of stuff they didn't mean to cause or were caused by a very select few.

\-Vegetables go great on Hamburgers, I hate when people say that tomatoes/onions/lettuce don't belong on them. They make Hamburgers much better.

\-AI is a terribly overrated and bad idea that people only support because they only see the positive side of it.

\-Fat chicks are sexy as fuck.

\-Modern Sonic Games are just as good as the Genesis and Dreamcast games.

\-Modern architecture and home design sucks. I love the aesthetic of ""Pre-Recession"" houses. Today they're all built out of cardboard and are only useful for looking nice.

\-They should have rebuilt the Twin Towers. The new one looks only ok at most, I love the Brutalist architecture designs of the originals.

\-Flip Phones and Slider Phones are better than smartphones, and they should make a comeback.",unpopularopinion
"Men face a more unrealistic standard of beauty than women, they just don't complain about it.","You hear it every day. Women complaining about the unrealistic standard of beauty they are faced with. They act like its women and only women. 

Well, hello Brad Pitt, Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Chris hemsworth, Jason momoa, dwayne Johnson, John cena, Channing Tatum, etc, etc...the list goes on.

The ""standard"" women face is for the most part weight. Most overweight people have the ability to exercise and diet to cut their weight, and although theres a rare few who have conditions causing their obesity, most of them are just too lazy and lack the discipline to drop the pounds. Plus there's all of those ""love your body"" campaigns trying to make overweight women feel like they're ""good enough"". At least they have makeup as a viable option.

 Sure losing weight is hard but let's look at what men are facing.

Let's start with height. Gotta be 6ft or taller. 5'11 doesnt cut it, and apparently they can tell the difference. I'm kidding, they cant, but if they ask you, and you're 5'10 or 5'11, you better lie because apparently those few inches are a deal breaker. Men face the SAME struggle with weight, *Billy May's voice* -- but wait, theres more! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a ripped body like all those male celebs that parade around shirtless in the movies? Its REALLY fucking hard. For some people, it's not even possible. It goes beyond weight. Female celebs get boob jobs, ass jobs, etc, which any woman can get, but the men have to train for years to get the body you see in movies and magazines. To top it off, we cant wear makeup either. Not that we want to, but as a man you have to show every flaw you have, yet they call that plus sized female model who couldn't put down the fork the brave one.

So please, stop acting like women are the only one facing an unrealistic standard. Sure men could complain, but complaining about it would make them seem like less of a man, so I guess that's another thing to add to the list.",unpopularopinion

"A 24hr rule is needed for every breaking story or viral vid that incites mob anger. I was one of the angry people yesterday w/ the viral clips of the NA elder &amp; kids in MAGA hats, and have done a complete 180 and don't blame the kids at all.","I really wish people followed a 24hr rule and got more information before social media nut jobs go crazy over viral clips. My heart sank and I was immediately pissed off when I saw the viral clips on twitter where kids w/ the MAGA hats looked like they were harassing an elderly NA man. He looked like he could be my Lolo Albino and I just couldn't imagine myself walking up to someone elderly and choosing to target and harass them. 





I went searching for other video clips and information about the incident where they said that these kids approached the elder, interrupted a ceremony, got in his face and started chanting things like ""build the wall."" I did not find evidence of that, but I did find a whole bunch of other footage and tried to piece everything together. 


I found a statement from one of the kids that a local reporter [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/AClementsWKRC/status/1086822521012473858) w/ a bunch of video clips he mentions in the statement.

- From a [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EC1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI), it shows them street preaching to the NA group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. Some NA people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. The group of kids aren't seen until [46:41](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. 





- The group of kids congregate off to the side seen on [1:05:00](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting I assume for a bus to pick them up. BHI turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. I do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. More kids meet up with the group; I guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. One street preacher provides commentary on their chants. Kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and BHI jokes(?) that they're kneeling to Israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the NA group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. Some people in the NA group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. The kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. No one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. And while I might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the NA chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). These kids did not approach the NA group, interrupting their ceremony. The rest of the video is BHI talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them.





- Close up of when the NA group approached the student group as they were doing another chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLJLjuiRg8






- Another [video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npX801xLSFY) The small group of kids confronting BHI starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. Several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the NA group. A couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the NA group is doing at [1'06""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=66) and [1'20""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=82). People on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. But it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. Like, I myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. 






- Off to the side, a man from the NA group is heard talking to another kid at [1:35](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=95), saying ""white people, go back to Europe where you came from...this is not your land..."" Things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the NA elder turns to the other kid at [2:09](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. That, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. Things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. The rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the NA group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more BHI preaching stuff where they call [""trump a homosexual""/rants about gays/etc](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive.







- After looking at what I think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason.  The viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. It's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. It's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and I'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. Yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. So far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. It's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what I thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids.

It's perfectly OK for a man to hit a woman back if she hit him first,"The most popular argument against this is that ""*men are stronger*"". Yes, but why pick a fight with someone far stronger than you? If I walk into a gym and punched the biggest guy there in the face, should I cry foul if he hits back?

Granted, I can't exactly call it self-defense. Chances are, a woman hitting a man isn't exactly a threat to his life. But it doesn't have to be. She is trying to cause him pain. He should have the right to cause her pain in return. I'm not saying he should go ape-shit on her and send her into a coma, but at the same time he should have the right hit her with the intention of causing her pain.

Far too often I see women hitting men *knowing* they won't hit back. This expectation that men won't hit back encourages women like this to be aggressive. Men don't pick fights with bigger men because they have a rational fear of the bigger guy hitting back. Too often, women use this expectation of chivalry as armor.",unpopularopinion
"If high school was the best years of your life, you have a very sad life.","You hear this sentiment often, especially from folks who were football players, cheerleaders, etc (generally popular groups). I hope they have had actually made a life for themselves after high school, but in my experience (being out of school for 22 years now)...I find the opposite to be true. The former popular kids I run into are just sad looking with dirty kids pulling on their clothes. They look depressed.

While, the ""nerdy"" kids who were basically social outcasts (especially in the 90's) are now successful, and driving nice cars...and generally look pretty damn happy!

Edit: I should have elaborated to say it’s sad, because high school is when you do not know who you are (figuring it all out), and most teens are awkward (in their own ways). Congratulations if you enjoyed high school... I don’t intend to invalidate your experience (I guess that’s the PC way to say that).

"All bodies are not beautiful, healthy bodies are beautiful.","I’d like to preface this by saying that I do appreciate the spirit behind the statement that all bodies are beautiful. I think it’s very cool that people want others to feel accepted and comfortable despite being different than a perceived majority. 

However, all bodies are not beautiful, and we shouldn’t pretend they are. People that are overweight to the degree it affects their health are not beautiful, they’re unhealthy. They don’t deserve to be mistreated for it, but they also shouldn’t be constantly validated. 

There is a biological standard for objective physical attraction partially rooted in physical health. We are not attracted to people that won’t be healthy mates. We are not attracted to people that look unhealthy. We should stop pretending unhealthy bodies are attractive because they aren’t. I hate seeing people validate someone’s unhealthy lifestyle because they don’t want them to feel bad. It’s not a good way to help people, it just makes things worse.

Edit 1: Reading the comments I saw a few people telling me that I was talking about a skinny body and that I should clarify that. That’s not quite true. Skinny can also be unhealthy and therefore unattractive, but it is true that I am mostly addressing weight when I talk about a healthy body. 

Edit 2: I don’t think that amputations or scars make a person not beautiful. If your body is healthy, it’s beautiful. It’s a very cut-and-dry opinion. If you have scars, had an amputation for medical reasons, or anything like that your body can certainly still be beautiful. I only want my post to address things that are in the control of the person.

Edit 3: Hopefully my final edit. I’m sorry if I have been unclear. I have a lot of comments about how beauty is subjective, so let me clarify: this post refers to an objective standard of physical attraction that is held by having a healthy body and lost by having an unhealthy body. I understand attraction can have a subjective element, that’s not where my opinion is based though!",unpopularopinion

"Society needs to stop defending gang activity and ""hood life""","I'm not sure how to put this, the title really explains it the best here.  I'm also writing this at 4:46 AM so bear with me, I just wanted to put it down into words before I forgot.

I live in New York. I've seen my fair share of hoods.  And I browse social media and listen to tons of music, just to see people defending gang activity and such.

I really don't get it. People know killing and stealing is wrong, yet they glorify these people for their ""struggles"" when they definitely get involved with violent activity. Being poor does not give you the right to kill and steal! But people will blindly listen to hiphop and rap because it's ""woke"" and they sympathize with these asshole rappers. It's become cool to break the law because ""fuck the police"", and all police use excessive force, apparently.

People on social media seem to just be so proud of their gang relations, and the crimes they commit, and post about it to their blind audience who likes and retweets everything about it. People listen to hiphop where rappers sing about the atrocities they have and still commit, and people will be like ""yo i fuck with this"" and ""yo this is so woke"".   I fucking hate it.

Gangs have become a race thing. If you're against gangs, you're racist, it seems. People have tied gangs to specific races such as latinos and black people. And I think that's why it's normified, both indirectly and directly. I've literally seen movements such as ""protect our hoods"" try and directly stop deslumification. It's so stupid- there is nothing good about breaking the law or being in poverty. But people really think that this is how life is for black and latino people, which really contributes to the racism we have today.

I seriously wish we didn't come to this. A society of violent assholes seems to be on the rise to social acceptance, and it's a huge tumor to everyone. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of here. Defending rape, mugging, killing, drug dealing, etc. makes you just as bad as the person committing them.

Men respect women more than women respect men,"I know this sounds contrary to everything you've heard, but hear me out. From guys, I hear plenty of stupid comments.

But I've only heard genuine loathing from women. ""Men are all the same"" ""Men are trash"" They're monsters, creeps, and on and on. And it isn't just certain men. I've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. I've never heard any man say they hate all women, but I've heard women say they hate all men. 

Lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. When men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. If a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. This is a generality of course and I can only speak from my own experience. 

Then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. Teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. Constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women. But very rarely have I seen it in reverse. I've encountered it maybe twice in my life. Many messages talking about how we need to respect women; very little about respecting men.

Thing is, most people respond with something some sort of comments of adulation, which I do not understand. 

I have vastly more respect for single parents that don't use being a single parent as a crutch or a method for attention grabbing. 

Edit: Some of my replies to comments are getting buried, so I'll clarify a few things:

1. Obviously I'm not talking about widows, etc. I'm talking about those women that made poor life choices and then attempt to virtue signal, especially on social media.

2. Poor life choices include not using at least two methods of birth control during sex. If birth control is not your priority, you should not be having sex.

The total suicides between ages 15-24 in 2014 was 5,079, meaning for every death by school shooting since 2000 about 19.5 suicides occurred. Now let's add in the 2017 numbers (6,265) to the 2014 numbers and we get 11,331 which brings the ration between suicides and school shooting deaths from 19.5-1 to 43.5-1. Now I couldn't find the total number of suicides in that age range since 2000 but let's take 11,331 and decide in half, we get 5,665.5 which when multiply that by 18 (counting from '00-18) we have an estimated 101,979 teen/young adult suicides between 2000 and 2018 bringing the ratio of suicides to school shooting deaths to about 392-1. Meanging for the 15 teens that died in Parkland 5,880 suicides occurred. No marches, no fanfare, no calls for awarness to this silent crisis, just empty handed memorial yearbook pages is all the honor theyll ever be given.",unpopularopinion
An open relationship is just someone cheating on their partner and their partner being too much of a mug to do anything about it.,"Pretty much the title.

Sex wise, I'm completely open. However, I genuinely believe open relationships are people who aren't emotionally mature enough to be in a real relationship.

If you want to sleep with as many people as you can in one week - go ahead, no one is stopping you but you have to realise that that is what you are doing. You have a guy/girl on the side who you also have sex with whilst your partner waits at home? Cool, but you do realise resentment will form after a while.?

You aren't in a real relationship. You might live with your SO sure, but that's all. You don't have the exclusivity, the true companionship, the intimacy. You're essentially roommates who shag different people.

I've both known and know a few folk in open relationships and it never ends well. Someone always gets jealous or develops feeling for the other person.

Miss Piggy is in an abusive relationship with Kermit the frog where she is the abuser. Her character normalizes abuse of men though inappropriate humor.,"Have you ever asked yourself how the relationship with Kermit and Miss Piggy would look if it was the male character who held unrealistic expectations of his partner, always wanted more physical intimacy than she was willing to give him and would quickly become violent if his advances were rejected or his high expectations weren't met? Clearly these characters were a product of another era, but we've evolved to understand that is not a healthy relationship. When women act like Miss Piggy they're called divas. When men act like her they go to jail. We need to stop sending this mixed message to our children. It is never funny to hit your partner. It is never okay to become violently angry with them because they won't kiss you or because they don't share the same feelings you have. If there is a such thing as ""toxic femininity"" Miss Piggy would be the poster child of it. She is the quintessential ""nice girl"" and she has a narcissistic personality disorder that would make Caligula blush. She isn't funny and we shouldn't teach our children that what she does is acceptable.",unpopularopinion

No one should feel bad for catching a ball at a baseball game and not giving it to a nearby child.,"I’m even okay with wrestling it away so long as no one is hurt. (**EDIT: this refers to a simultaneous possession/catch scenario where the kid and i both have our hands on the ball at the same time. I am NOT okay with an adult running over to a kid who already caught it and snatching it away. But if the kid competes with me to catch it, I’m winning that competition and not feeling the least bit bad about it.**)Imagine if you’re a baseball fan who’s been going to games their whole life and you don’t get a chance to catch a ball until you’re like 34 or something. You catch one and someone’s little kid is nearby and they’re either crying or giving you that Oliver Twist “May I have some more?” look.

If you want to give the kid the ball, great. If you don’t and you keep it, also great. I mean, think of who has more invested, here. The adult likely bought their own ticket, has been a loyal fan of MLB for much longer, understands and appreciates the game at a higher level than the child, will probably take better care of the ball.

But of course the cameras will be on you and everyone will be ready to hate you if you don’t give the kid the ball. As a person who wants kids, fuck dem kids. It’ll be a good lesson in how unfair life is. So let’s weigh pros and cons.

If you give the ball away, people will say you’re a swell person online, but you’ll be upset because you don’t have the ball. 

If you keep the ball, people will shit on you online and likely in the stadium, but then they’ll forget AND you still have the ball. Kid will forget by next week. 

The winning option is clear. I’m not even a huge baseball fan but if I should so happen to be at a Cardinal’s game one day and I catch a ball, I am keeping it and ignoring every kid near me unless it’s my own kid.

**EDIT2: since people keep asking why an adult would want to keep the ball, a Blues player gave me a hockey puck a little while back. It sits on my mantle and is a great conversation piece. The baseball would do the same thing. But also, if I wanted to give the ball to my dog as a toy, that’s my prerogative. The happiness of my husky means more to me than the happiness of some random kid. I also have friends who are huge baseball fans with kids who play. One kid I know personally and play chess with is 14 and a very good player and dreams to make it to the MLB. I can also see myself giving it to him. The point is, though, that what i do with it could be anything I want. It’s mine.**

College applications should be completely anonymous.,"As the title says I think applications for college should be completely anonymous. They should only get your grades, test scores, extra curricular activities, etc. There is no reason for the schools to even know your gender, race, or economic background. I don’t think any one applicant should be given even a fraction of an edge based off of any of those criteria. It should be 100% merit based. 

I was advised to add a little more to this but I don’t really have any more to add. It’s simple really, I don’t understand why it is necessary for the admissions team to even know these characteristics. While obviously for many schools there are interviews, in those cases it would be anonymous up until you where offered to come in for an interview. They shouldn’t even be given a name, just an application number at the top. This would combat racism, sexism, nepotism, and hopefully any other bias that might affect the application process if even by a small percent.",unpopularopinion

The current lack of human natural selection is detrimental to progress,"Right now, there are 7.7 billion humans sharing Earth. This population is unsustainable considering the average intelligence of a human. The standard where we are now required to keep everyone alive and with basic necessities goes against the fundamental principle of how life has always worked. Why are we letting low IQ people who are addicted to drugs and on food stamps reproduce? A couple of hundred years ago, and these people are systematically taken care of by nature. Now the burden is on everyone else to take care of a growing class of idiots who will never contribute to society. Not only are they not producing, but hinder the progress of the brightest because their hard work is being sapped by the bottom 50%. No other species does this, humans are a special and remarkable species but to ignore the rules of nature has proven to be foolish. Other animals love their offspring as well, but they also understand that if their kid is too weak to independently survive, keeping him/her alive will cause their entire species to eventually go extinct. The short term value of not naturally selecting a better human population is just asking for the entire population to collapse, which will probably happen in the next couple hundred of years at this point considering how greedy humans are.

If Women have the right to abort a child then people should have the right to Voluntarily Euthanasia,"For example “My Body, My Choice”, Women (In the United States) have the right to abort a fetus if they decide if they don’t want a child for either financial reasons or any other reasons they do not want to be mother for any other reason.

People that are going through Depression should have the right to Voluntarily Euthanasia because they don’t want to be alive anymore. The reason I am discussing this method of death is because imagine your suicidal struggling with mental illness and your only choices are the most gruesome methods of death such as a gun, (Which Gun laws are getting even stricter) and a Rope, or other methods like allowing yourself to get hit by a car or train.
Obviously if your struggling you don’t what your family to come home to see your lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling or your brains just simply splattered like paint all over the bedroom walls and ceiling. Using someone else to kill you like a Truck or train imho is just selfish and not morally right, imagine leaving a burden on them because they technically are the cause of your death and are charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Another reason people should be entitled to Euthanasia because the Mental Healthcare system in the US is a joke. Take it from me, a person that’s been having expensive therapy sessions for over 4 years with many different therapists and I admit I have tried Suicide once which is what gotten me Therapy in the first place. The Second time I felt Suicidal tendencies I called an Anonymous hotline just to talk about feeling worthless and a few minutes later I had a bunch of squad cars at my door.

How come people on Death Row get Euthanasia after the government spends more money housing and caring for inmates than the people in mental hospitals that’s been suffering for years and wish for the sweet release of death?

My Grandmothers brother had suffered from dementia in the last 2 years of his life in hospice, on some days he would smile upon seeing his sisters face and on the other days he would speak gibberish and start ranting. I’m sure he didn’t understand the concept of what was going on his mind but I’m sure he begged for the mental and emotional pain to go away.

I think it's disgusting how teenage boys are held to a higher standard than adult women when it comes to sexual misconduct,"The fact that people are more outraged by a 15 year old boy groping a girl his own age than they would be by an 30 year old woman having sex with a 15 year old boy speaks volumes.

People keep deriding the whole concept of ""boys will be boys"" calling it misogyny and what not. Uhhh actually it *is* normal for people to do stupid and reckless things in their teens. They have not developed impulse control yet. What's *not* normal is this sick adult women lusting after teenage boys scenario that the media is always portaying these days.

EDIT: All these people commenting that these two things are the same and that they should be dealt with equally harshly proves my point. I guarantee that if we were talking about a 30 year old man having sex with a 15 year old girl vs a 15 year old boy groping a 15 year old girl, there would be unanimous agreement that the adult pedophile/hebophile is much worse. Not only are we comparing the behavior of an adult to that of a child, but we are also comparing statutory rape to groping. But somehow they're equally heinous. Yeah you can't tell me there isn't a gender bias.

Trevor Noah isn't funny.,"TDS used to be my all-time favorite show, and Jon Stewart is someone I idolized as a writer, comic and activist. It was a shame when he retired but it was time for that awesome torch to be passed. Trevor Noah was announced and I didn't know much about him but thought it would be cool to get a change of scenery and a fresh perspective.

I remember he got in trouble because of some offensive tweets about jewish people. Not only were the tweets completely unwarranted, they weren't even funny. He was trying to make a jew joke and it straight up and down wasn't even funny. So I watched his Netflix special at the time. Not only was it not funny, it was one of the more worse standup specials on Netflix, and I've seen almost all of them.

So I watched him on the Daily Show for months, thinking he'll eventually get into a groove and a good zone to start unleashing that high-octane wit that was associated with the program. I GENUINELY, SINCERELY, from the bottom of my heart tried to get into him, for so long, and that same lame-ass, tired, run-into-the-ground racial observations, penis jokes and impersonations of different accents that was the bread and butter for his standup didn't change. At least the Daily show was good at calling out media bullshit, but now under Trevor it has just become a mouthpiece for the media bullshit that Jon worked so passionately to combat.

**TL;DR**: I know that humor is subjective, but from my earnest and sincere perspective, gained by watching hours of the show, and all of his Netflix specials, my opinion has only solidified that not only is he not a funny/good comedian, but he is one of the worst out there, along with Jeff Dunham, Gabriel Iglesias, and... fuck it, Ricky Gervais.",unpopularopinion

"Holding students back from leaving the classroom due to one student acting up causes them to hate the teacher, not the one student.","Apparently my coworkers believe I should of held my class back today and not just the one student.

Apparently the students would hate the one student for holding them up and not teacher.

I always hated that because I could hear the grumbles and mumbles of an angry students. And the anger is towards me and not the one student. 

I feel like it is better to escort my class to the lunchroom. And escort the one student back to my class. That one student will see and hear all of their classmates having a fun time in the lunch room. Laughing, talking, goofing around, and trading food.

And be bummed sitting in the classroom alone and board with me. All I do is text my husband, go on reddit, and grade papers. That one student has to eat and think about their actions.

And after lunch my students get to run around and play on the playground. Depending how disruptive the student was, I keep them in for 5 or 10 minutes.

During this time I make the one student clean desks, staple papers together, or other minor stuff. 

After they are done, I ask them if they understood why I kept them in. Add a heart to heart chat. Tell them I appreciate the work they did in my room today. And let them go.

But today my coworkers told me I am doing it wrong. I need to keep my whole class in. The students will hate that one student and the one student will feel guilty enough to stop. Friends giving the friend the stink eye ensures that they won't act up again.

However 4/5 times the one student acting up is just part of a bigger problem. There could be stress at home that is causing them to act out. Having them alone in my room, time to calm down, think things out, and a heart to heart talk shows them that this is a safe place to talk with a trusted adult. 

It could be something small like stressing out over the next test. Or something big. I have had the toughest of bullies crying in my room because their parents are divorcing and they think it is all their fault.

I tried telling this to my coworker but they say if the student is really having trouble at home, they will to come to us for help.

I can't get half my students to admit when they need a pencil. I have one kid so shy he only speaks to me, the librarian, and his parents in whisper. Took me five months for me to get him to nod yes and no to me in front of the other students.

I don't know where my co-workers are getting the outgoing students.

Honestly, my shy student will be the only one happy staying in my room for lunch if one student acts up. But the rest will have the look of murder in their eyes. 

More so if it is Friday and pizza is being severed in the lunchroom. Hell if I hold my students up for a second on pizza day there will be a riot in my room. 

I been doing this since I first started teaching a couple years ago. Then again, I am a young teacher. And my coworkers are a bit older. Does experience have to do with it? Will I change my mind when I am older? 

For now, my method works. My class average is above the rest of my coworkers. My students are happy in class. I have a couple of students I see during recess and after school that just need to talk some stuff out.

Minecraft is a genuinely fun and interesting game. It’s not cringy or just for 12 year olds.,"I’ve been playing Minecraft for almost 10 years now. I remember the golden days with channels like “SkydoesMinecraft”, “ASFJerome” and “Bajancanadian”. I have always liked Minecraft, as it’s a world where you can build literally anything, in your own little world. There’s still a considerable amount of people that play it, but Minecraft has definitely been one of the highlights of my childhood. 

Edit 1: I see a lot of people claiming this as a popular opinion. Everyone knows that Minecraft has loads of hate around the game (generally the community) I see people all the time trashing the community, saying it’s full of annoying squeakers and losers. The way i’ve seen it from my perspective is that this is an unpopular opinion.

Edit 2: A lot of people remember when there were all of the clickbait Herobrine videos and all of the little kids that ruined the community. The kids have mostly moved to Fortnite, but it still stands that Minecraft does get a lot of negative feedback. If I would have posted this on any other social media platform I would definitely have lots of negative comments and many people disagreeing with me.

Edit 3: I’m getting many comments saying how they left Minecraft because they thought it was boring at times. I can understand that, but i’ll always find a time to come back to it.",unpopularopinion
Kids at political events are brainwashed,"If your kid is under ten, they're blindly agreeing with you, and that tendency to blindly agree with authority or party is bad. 

Don't bring your kids with you, and don't force your politics on them. 


Teenagers, fine. 

An eight year old is just going to hear ""these people are bad."" and agree, not think about the policies. 

If you're thinking ""but who will take care of my kids while I'm there?"" You're putting politics over your kids positive development. 

Edit:dozen comments about “the adults are brainwashed too.” By brainwashed, I’m saying that the kids are incapable of understanding the policies they are advocating for.

This also applies to the two dozen comments about going to church. My definition of brainwashed doesn’t include that, and I’ve responded to it enough that I’d prefer for you to scroll through the thread. Won’t be starting new comment lines about that. Religion is about morality and belief. Politics is about policy decisions.

Adults obsessed with Disney weird me out.,"Maybe this is regional as I am from Florida, but I know so many grown ass adults (mostly women, some drag their SO’s there with them and it shows) who obsess over going to Disney World. They have countless tank tops with dumb Disney quotes and puns on them, tons of those stupid Minnie ears, and post memes about how they’re counting down the days until they’re back at Disney. Some of them have young kids, but most of them either have no kids, have adult kids, or were like this before having kids. Maybe I’m just a no-fun bitch, but I don’t get what is so amazing about putting on dumb ears and wandering around in the blistering heat, in a disgustingly crowded amusement park, paying a million dollars to stand in line for hours of your day. Even as a kid, I had no interest in Disney more than once every few years.  For the most part, it’s the same shit every time.

If I were given legal permission to eat human flesh I would happily try it,"The idea of eating of human flesh has always made me curious, now I'm not saying that I wanna eat humans, I'd just only eat if I were I given permission or if the corpse died recently like in a car crash.

 I told this to every one in my religion/philosophy class where we were discussing moral desicion making. If you know that senario where you're in WW2 and your hiding from the nazis with a group of people but then suddenly the baby starts crying. Would you kill the baby and save everyone in the room or dont do anything and get everyone killed including yourself

Most people said kill the baby and I followed up with it saying ""Yeah, and if were hungry we can eat the baby, since at that time of war, you wouldn't wanna starve""

Everyone in that class were freaking out by what I said and the teacher was speechless. And now they bring it up everytime in class. I don't mind it really but surely people must agree with me on this.

Edit: This is my most upvoted post on reddit. And its about cannibalism. I just wanna make something clear because some guy just tried to report me to the  DOJ.

 I dont want to murder people. I just wanna try out a sample of human flesh, only for the legal reasons. I am crazy, but I'm not insane to go on some quest for the flesh. I have more important things to do in life. And if this bites me back in the ass. Its just gonna be wasting everyones time because I have no interest in pursuing this. Its more of the curiousity of it, not the actions. Thank you and goodbye

Edit 2: Also to mention people are saying ""prion diseases"" and you're right. I don't want to get prion disease, so theres no way I'll be eating human anytime soon. 😂

Edit 3: People are also saying ""why not just eat my own self""? Well because thats auto-cannibalism. I rather have my limbs and flesh to my self. If someone was mad enough to amputate him/herself and offer me flesh. Thens theres nothing stopping me from eating it, is there?

Edit 4: So suprisingly this is blowing up, faster than I expected to be. I got a message from CRD (cyber security). So I'm being traced now which is jussssst great. Like I don't mind really, as long as they  don't come knocking on my door. This is was only an opinion I expressed on /r/UnpopularOpinions and it was all fun and goofs.

This situation is getting too serious, I never did or said anything that was illegal. I know what I wrote was gross and inhumane but doesn't mean you have to get me behind bars for it.

People who commit suicide by jumping in front of trains/buses/cars etc are the worst type of asshole.,"Suicide is a real issue. It's a worldwide issue. People kill themselves for many different reasons and it's tragic.

My heart goes out to the people suffering so badly they want it all to end. My heart goes out to their families and friends. 

But if you jump in front of a train (or any vehicle driven by others) to end it all you're a piece of shit. 

You want to kill yourself that's your business. I wish you didn't feel you had to and I wish you felt you could get help. But don't completely fuck up others lives! How dare you destroy the life of the innocent drivers and lives of their passengers for your selfish desire to end your own!

End of the day you don't care. You're dead. The living have to try and put their lives together and go on. You don't.

But fuck you. Asshole.

Edited to fix spelling.

Edit to add:

I didn't expect this to blow up like it did.

To those people saying I don't know what it's like to be suicidal or I'm underestimating the pain,
I don't underestimate. I've been there.

I'm not saying people who kill themselves in this manner are  annoying ME persay, I'm saying their actions by killing themselves in that manner can potentially fuck up the lives of strangers. Innocent people like the bus driver just doing his job. The kid going to school. The person struggling with their own mental demons. 

How is that not selfish?

How is that not wrong?

It's terrible when people feel they need to end it all. Some, like me, get help or pull themselves through it. Some don't and that's tragic. 

But yes I get upset when innocents suffer because of the actions of one. I've seen it too many times not to get upset. 

So I make no apologies for my opinion other than to say perhaps the aggression and swearing could have been worded better and still got the point across.

Teachers are not martyrs. They are working professionals trying to make a living just like the rest of us and the self-righteous attitude many of them have is honestly so annoying.,"Teachers like to complain about how they aren't paid enough and act like they're God's gift to society. Now I'm not denying their importance but the thing is, all professions are important. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, cleaners and garbage collectors all have important roles to play in society, and their pay is determined by the market and they only work 9 months of the year. 

Also the thing is, many teachers suck. They literally just read off slideshows and textbooks, in my opinion only maths and science teachers really deserve credit. 

When I was in grade 5 my one teacher left halfway through the year and came back the next year (presumably with full pay) because she couldn't handle how naughty the kids were. Like woman, that's your job. Also, when I was in grade 10 my accounting teacher had a breakdown because one of the kids told her she was a shitty teacher (and truth be told, he wasn't wrong). She went crazy at him, kicked him out of the class and didn't come to work for 2 weeks after that. Like, wtf. I worked as a waiter for several years during college and if a customer complained about me, I'd have to just suck it up and carry on, I couldn't lose my cool at the customer and God forbid I'd go AWOL for 2 weeks. 

So yeah. Teachers like to act like they sacrificed their lives for the good of education, which they didn't. They chose to teach as a career and must deal with the good and bad aspects of the job.",unpopularopinion

Some people are just plain stupid and should be given up on,"I’m a tutor and a substitute teacher working on getting a full time credential. The mantra is always something about no child left behind or how every kid has potential to do good. 

No. Some kids are just fucking stupid. 

I’ve tutored a high schooler who legitimately did not know what 2+2 was, and they weren’t special Ed or trying to be funny or anything like that. Some people are just stupid and it’s their own fault they fail, not the fault of anyone around them. No amount of extra hard work from their teachers or tutors will make them smarter. They’ll always be stupid. They’re the kids where you painstakingly walk them through every single step in solving a problem, and then for the next one they have no idea what to do even though it’s the exact same problem with slightly different numbers or words, and then you repeat this process every day 5 days a week until it’s summer break and you’ve gotten nowhere the entire time with them. 

They should be given up on. These people don’t even want to succeed in academics. They’re the ones talking about how you can’t ask a fish to climb a tree to justify how it’s okay that they suck at important life skills but they’re semi decent at fortnite dancing and hot dog eating, as if the skills are comparable in value. Not only are they so thick that their brain is locked behind an impenetrable brick wall, but they straight up don’t even think an education is valuable so they don’t give a shit anyways. It’s a waste of everyone’s time to force teachers to teach at the pace of the slowest kid, take time away from those who can learn to dedicate more time to the idiot, and to hire a tutor to try to magically make the idiot smarter. 

Valuable time and resources dedicated to helping these failures shouldn’t be given to them. That extra time should be spent working with the kids who actually can learn and want to learn. Plenty of parents have thrown hundreds of dollars at me a month to make their kid smarter and get better grades, only for their kid to be completely hopeless. It was a waste of their money and I knew from the first day that their kid wouldn’t learn shit from me. 

These kids just need to be left behind. It’s not right to make everyone else worse off just to try to pour resources and time into a human who’s brain is a bag with a hole in the bottom. 

Edit: just wanted to point out that someone took the time to PM me and say I’m a dick and a toad because people make way more money playing fortnite and eating hotdogs than the $5 an hour he assumes teachers make. I’ll just let that stand for itself. 

Edit 2: just to clarify since I can’t reply to hundreds of comments, what I am NOT advocating for is throwing these kids out on the streets. What I am saying is that right now the sole goal of our education system is to get kids into college. That should change. Some kids aren’t capable of that and that’s okay. We should push some people into more realistic work and blue collar jobs instead of ONLY trying to get kids to have a high enough GPA for college. Give up on trying to teach a kid a life skill they won’t use and try teaching them something else valuable to society.",unpopularopinion
Teachers should not be allowed to express their political opinions in school.,"Bit of context for this. When I was 16 (in 2006) I studies politics in the UK. Both my teachers supported Labour as did almost all of the class, but that isn't the issue. The issue came about when I made a prediction that the Conservatives would win the next general election (they did). Now, this wasn't me declaring any support for either party. It was literally just an observation. My teacher then went on to explain how bad the Conservative party is, how everybody in the class should vote Labour and that I was a 'Tory boy'. Basically for the next two years my opinions and views in class were null and void because, and I quote, ""don't listen to the Tory Boy"". Also, other classmates who had different opinions to the class and teachers aligned with them to make sure they didn't get the same vitriol thrown their way.

To be clear, I have no issue with teachers telling student's who they voted for. I do take issue when they seek to impose their opinions on the class. They're there to educate. Not dictate.

Friends is an overrated show and shouldn’t have been kept on Netflix at the cost of increased subscription payments,"Although friends is considered to be loved by “everyone”, it has been blown out of proportion by fans claiming it to be the best thing on tv forever and always.

Just buy the box set for friends and for a single price, why keep paying a monthly subscription to just watch a single show? Netflix has paid around $100 million for the show to stream throughout 2019, and the payment before that was $30 million according to New York Times.

"Public School Teachers are OVERpaid, not underpaid.","Very unpopular opinion that I have literally received death threats for. 

Public school teachers in the United States earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  This is far too HIGH.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/Public-School-Teacher-Salary.html

I’m not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  I am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  Public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. This artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (The purpose of a union). It’s revealed in the numbers.  Private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  Some estimates are as low as $37,000.  

https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Private_School_Teacher/Salary

Teachers Union Convention, NEA top official - It’s not for the kids, it’s for the power.

https://youtu.be/baM8N24K8kE

2.  The median HOUSEHOLD income in the United States is only about $62,000.  That means that ONE teacher’s income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

But wait Billy Mays, There’s more. 

3.  Teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  Private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  Business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since Christmas and New Years etc. happen for everyone - 

Annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

And please, don’t tell me “Teachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little Johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.”  Stop it.  Third Grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and I know teachers who do just that. 

Teaching is not easy, but it’s not hard either.  And yes, before you say “try it once and stand in my shoes” - I have.  

4.  On average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  They are more facilitators than professionals. 

“These kids get out of high school and can’t even read.”  

Proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it’s measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  Math often under 50%.  Half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  Private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

It’s because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  And when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it’s unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

You can peruse this trove of data if you like.  It’s fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=FFOption3#faqFFOption3

“It’s the parents, not us.”  

You’ll often hear this in response.  And it’s true, parents are extremely important in little Johnnie’s life and success.  But that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  They are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little Billy the bully ready even when he’s a dick and won’t pay attention.  The gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn’t do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  Her job is to get slow witted Corky some knowledge because he can’t learn on his own. 

5.  Schools are becoming prison camps.  For what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  I don’t think it’s because there were no Donnie the drug dealer and Billy the bully when we Generation Xers were growing up.  It’s because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  There is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  Cops are everywhere.  Students have few if any rights.  The kids are treated with disrespect and ‘zero-tolerance’ policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  It gets worse each year. 

I do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  I believe it’s because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that “teachers are overworked and underpaid” has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  They have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/sO_gKQUuISc

Like I said, I’ve had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  It’s dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

Yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it’s about the power.

The reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.,"Now I want to start this by saying I don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

Women are picky af. Men aren't. It's in our genetics.

For a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. You gotta have -

1. Good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. You usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. You need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. You usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. A woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. A man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

If a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on Friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

A man doing this? No way. It's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. And if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

There have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete Adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

Correcting someone elses child's disrespectful behavior should be acceptable,"I was recently at a party and one of the partygoers brought their child. I have nothing against kids but this little one was being an outright menace. He started screaming and crying when the cake was being served because he wasn't the first one to get cake and then flipped his mom off when she asked him to stop. He's four. It was extremely uncomfortable because Mom did nothing and awkwardly stood there and just let this happen. Party continues and he then is pitching golf balls at a window. My fiancé asks him nicely to stop (there were other kids nearby who she didn't want caught in the crossfire) and the mom went ballistic on her saying ""don't tell my kid how to act"" etc. If you can't be bothered to instill good behavior into your kid I feel like you shouldn't be insulted when other people do it for you

Edit: Hi everyone! So I wanted to quickly edit the main post because I've noticed a trend in people saying that physical reprimands on other people's children is okay, and I absolutely DO NOT approve of that in any way shape or form. What I'm talking about here is an incident where my fiancé used her best judgement to step in and ask a child to not throw golf balls at a window because there were other kids nearby.",unpopularopinion
Circumcising males when they’re infants should be illegal. I’ve never met a person who agrees with me and it’s infuriating.,"I think it’s barbaric. The foreskin is there to protect the glans. And as an infant it is literally fused to the head of the penis. So as a newborn, males have their foreskin ripped off the head of the penis and then cut off around the rim, sometimes with no anesthetic. And idk how you care for an open wound while keeping them in diapers that will eventually smear them in shit. 

It breaks my heart that my fiancé wants any future boys we have to be circumcised. And his only reason is “I want him to look like me”. I’ve told him I want him there to watch and listen to his newborn cry and scream from being mutilated for cosmetic reasons. I told him he will be the only one changing his diapers and treating the wound. 


“It’s gross lol” because you’ve grown up in a culture that has done this since biblical times. 

It is the exact equivalent of cutting off a baby girl’s labia. Oh, it’s for aesthetics. Oh, it will make girls less prone to utis. Oh, it’ll eliminate smegma that builds up between the folds. Oh, it’ll expose a mucus membrane and desensitize the clit. Oh, it’ll make them less likely to get labia cancer. Oh, it’ll prevent stds because there’s less folds for the disease to hide in.

Every “benefit” of circumcision is a matter of hygiene and the same “benefits” would apply to girls who get their labia cut off. 


This is something an adult should choose for themselves. Not something forced onto a baby. Many men DO choose to do it, and some of them might even prefer it, but the choice should be THEIRS.",unpopularopinion
"Calling a white person ""colonizer"" is equivalent to calling a black person ""spearchucker""","Using the phrase colonizer is quite popular on Blacktwitter when referring to whites and it seems to be on par with a white person calling a black person ""spear chucker"". referring to a person based on a historic event/action or cultural stereotype is racist like calling all Japanese ""raiders/kamakazi"", Somali ""pirates"", etc...

People seem to get away with it because of the belief that you cannot be racist against a white person in a western country, but that is just wrong. I believe that all things should be allowed to be said, but one cannot take the moral high ground and say they aren't racist when they say things like this

Edit: yeah I'm aware that probably a majority of people offline don't behave this way, hence why I mentioned an online community. Also I'm not personally ""fired up"" over this, I just think you can't pretend to be virtuous when you're being reductive and divisive.

"I'm Indian. Apu is not even a little bit offensive. On the contrary, he's one of the best POC representations for its era.","The Simpsons debuted in 1989, when the population was way more white, and the only really existent minority was black (and maybe Hispanic).  Indians basically didn't exist in the US.  

Typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  This is why Asian characters were shitty roles, while Black characters weren't; Blacks made up 12% of the population, while Asians were not even 1%.  White characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

Taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character Apu was written to be.  

Now the bad part:  His accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  I definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking Indian accent.  But again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

I don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  I've seen lots of Black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  I'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  That would *probably* necessitate the actor being Indian though.  

For comparison, let's look at Raj, from the Big Bang Theory, which aired in 2007.  BBT pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  And that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  Not to mention that BBT is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

My final take:  People crying about Apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the Indian people I know aren't even fazed by him.  I will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  Apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

The whole ""SJWs are insane"" narrative is largely overblown by fanatic right wing redditors, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, and this is one of those times.",unpopularopinion
"(From an American point of view) We are running out of real problems, so we make up stuff to be mad about.","From my own personal experience, I feel like society is really trying hard to find things to be upset about.

I’m sure everyone has their own experiences, but here’s a little background on me.... I was born in the US, but my parents are immigrants from the Middle East.  I was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  We didn’t have much growing up.  Both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  I grew up in Chicago.  We didn’t come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  They learned how to speak English, and just went from there.  My dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  We had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  My siblings and I picked up on that, but we didn’t want to add stress to them and played dumb.  They kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  At the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  We all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... Most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

So I feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  While this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  Especially today as we are Iraqi Christians (but that’s a whole other story).

I’m 32.  I’ve got a great job (even though I never finished college, couldn’t afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn’t get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), I finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, I’ve got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  All of my accomplishments, and my family’s have been through discipline and sacrifice.  I didn’t buy the nice car, I bought the used Honda.  I didn’t buy the fancy clothes, I went to discount stores.  I didn’t eat out, I cooked every night.  I lived well within my means.

To my point.  I really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  Why have people gotten so soft?  Every time I turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there’s a new artificial outrage that’s sweeping across the country.  Are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? Absolutely.  But I think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

Is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  I just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  If that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the US.  Is it evenly distributed? No, but life isn’t fair.",unpopularopinion

We need to focus on educating our kids about taking emotion out of it, and using rationale instead to come to conclusions.

Usain Bolt is so fast because he runs with a boner,"Now I'm no scientist but I've always wondered why he's so fast and after studying his races for 6 weeks I've come to the conclusion that its because he runs with a boner and here's why. So aerodynamically speaking a boner cuts through the wind resistance better than a flabby dick a flabby dick acts almost like a parachute adding wind resistance to the runner thus slowing him down. But Usain runs with boner thus acting like a spear cutting through the wind making the wind have the smallest affect on him. Where as his opponents flabby dicks slow them down. I do believe he uses performance enhancing drugs (viagra) to get and keep these race winning boners. Thank you for taking the time to read my research paper

"Adults (as in humans aged 18+) should not be offended by profanity. If they are, I don’t feel badly about it.","Using profanity doesn’t make you trashy, uneducated or violent. It allows some of us to express language in a more efficient manner. It’s so universal and powerful, which makes it very tempting to use, especially for those of us who struggle with effective communication in certain scenarios.

Because of cultural intensity prescribed to the word “fuck”, its utterance tends to be a verbally cathartic experience. Do we need people to hate its use, though, in order for it to retain power? In my opinion, no. 

When I was 13, I didn’t appreciate the power of profanity. I misused it in an attempt to feel important and more mature (older 🙄). At 32, I feel like I fully appreciate its role in efficient communication.

When kids at least pretended that they were adults, the negatives werent as noticeable.  I hate every post that begins ( im 12 but) or whatever. l think kids need to at least try to hide the fact their a kid and not brag about how immature they are

EDIT: People have been saying I hate kids. This isnt the case. I just take issue when some kid mentions their age on the internet as if it furthers an argument or statement they are making. If your point is solid, it can stand up without mentioning ur age. No one asked for your age. There are a few times when one would talk about age on the internet, but kids simply do talk about age at appropriate areas/threads/whatever. Like ive seen 12 year olds on r/relationshipadvice.

"Stop remaking great films and start remaking movies that could have been great, but were poorly executed","All the time we hear stories about films with so much hype but had production issues, cast issues, etc. There’s some great scripts that will probably never see the light of day because they were poorly executed on. We should remake those movies instead of ones that have already been executed greatly. 

Edit: ppl keep saying studios wouldn’t do this so it’s useless. Dark tower in an example of great source material (Steven Kings  magnum opus) but the film was godawful. Studios could draw back a crowd if it was remade well. Hancock is another one - the movie did okay but the original material was so different and in my opinion could have been a lot better. Prometheus was an awesome idea but didn’t really get as deep as I had hoped. All three of those I think were great ideas, poorly executed that would still make money as a remake if done right.

How many people are dying from being too thin versus too fat? How much more dangerous for the average person is diabetes, poor cardiovascular health, higher blood pressure, higher risk of stroke, knee injuries, etc. than taking in too few calories? It's inconceivable to me that on average, the effects  of glamorizing thin women would be worse than the opposite - people are FATTER THAN EVER, and most people could use a push towards less body fat, whereas helping people disregard the negative health impact of being obese is damaging for society.

People should be able to employ whatever models they want, and consumers should be able to read the ads they want, but lets not act like models being thin is worse for young women than models that are morbidly obese.

"Censoring ""hate speech"" makes you a coward","It shows that you're too afraid to debate your opponent and that them merely being alowed to speak intimidates you. 

No matter how wrong, offensive, violent, or amoral you think someone is, policing words is not the way to go. It creates an Orwellian echo-chamber where one set of ideas or opinions is considered ""right"" by virtually everyone. Morality is a social construct and therefore a highly subjective thing. If you truly believe someone is incorrect, stand your ground and attack them with words instead of crying ""pls remov dem from teh internet"" like a little baby. Are people just so sensitive that seeing words on a screen will cause them to spontaneously combust?

I think this is one of those cases where a good idea was taken hostage by people who care more about virtue signaling than actually helping the people in question.

Weed absolutely can be addicting and have negative consequences so it should not be represented as wonderfully as it is in the legalization movement,"I was a smoker/stoner for about the last 5 years and I can honestly say that I really struggled to quit and I still relapse from time to time. It was my go-to way to “relax” and “have a good time” but it allowed me to take the easy way out instead of finding other opportunities for hobbies or time with friends and family or meeting new people. As a result I find myself craving that escape from ‘normal’ life and I don’t have the skills to find something enjoyable to do on an uneventful evening. I want to smoke so bad but I know for me personally it makes me lazier and a less productive employee. At this point I really do feel like I’m recovering from an addiction.

Weed was also my ‘gateway drug’ as ridiculous as that claim seems to be for many people. I would never have considered other drugs until I felt how good it was to be high.

But the legalization movement characterizes weed as this wonderful thing that was wrongly made illegal. They seldom talk about these negative consequences to life and make it seem like nothing is bad about it.

That being said, I think it should be legal, we just need to respect it as the drug that it is and be clear that it is not for everyone and can cause harm to peoples lives. For some it is truly a live saving medicinal drug, so it should definitely be available to these people. But focusing the legalization effort on how much it does for people with difficult medical conditions paints weed in a much better light than it should be for the general population.

Fuck blowjobs,"I don't like blowjobs. I'm a guy by the way, I don't like getting blowjobs and most of my girlfriends in the past really like giving them. It's such an awkward situation, they feel...

I don't know man it's just not that great and it's kind of uncomfortable because if you don't enjoy it or pretend you enjoy it you make them feel shitty.

I also think its comparable to alcoholism if you're using super regularly. You're inhibiting yourself and changing the way your mind works.

I’m against extreme genderless parenting. It’s okay to not only give your kid girly/boyish things, or not only have them wear girly/boyish. Let kids play with what they want to play with. However, when you don’t teach children their sex is connected to their gender, you’re confusing young, impressionable children. Why would you not use pronouns if the chances are your kids gender is going to be the same as their sex. You’re confusing children making them worry about their gender identity when they’re just kids. If you’re kids talk about being transgendered and not feeling like their sex and wants you to call them something that’s different. Why treat your kid different just Incase they’re transgendered?

I’d rather have no children at all than a child with developmental or intellectual disabilities.,"I don’t have kids. I want them someday. 

I’ve talked about this with my girlfriend. I think by the time we are ready to have kids, it’s likely that we can *choose* whether or not they are born with certain disabilities. Or, if they’re prone to them, make sure they aren’t born with them. 

For example, she once asked if I would want a kid with Down syndrome. I said no. I wouldn’t love that child any less, of course, if there was no preventing it, **but** if I had to choose between having a child with Down syndrome and no child, I’d choose no child. Children are already a massive burden; financially, emotionally, and every-other-ally. Add a developmental disability on top? Not if I can help it. 

For context, my older brother (nearly 30) has an intellectual disability. Our parents have always been awesome with him, but eventually they won’t be around and he can’t live on his own. Likely, I’ll be his guardian. And that’s okay, I love my brother, but if I were my parents, having seen what they’ve sacrificed and do for him every day, I would have chosen not to have him. 

Is that bad of me to say? Am I an asshole? Maybe. But it’s my unpopular opinion.

Loving a future child and being more heavily burdened by its existence aren't necessarily mutually exclusive feelings. People have conflicting emotions all the time about all sorts of things.

If you are calling them beautiful because of the way they look, you are not only lying to them but also yourself. No, they are not attractive, and they shouldn’t have to be constantly lied to. I understand that people are saying these things with good intention, but instead of complimenting their appearance, how about actually praising the individual for going through life with this tough condition, or praising them for spreading awareness of it. That way, you aren’t lying to them by saying they are pretty, but you are still supporting them.

If you are calling them beautiful because of their personality, and the way they deal with their condition, then it’s equally as bad. You are seeing them online. You don’t know the person.

Pubs and bars are far better than a nightclub,"Could be a bias since I come from a family run pub now. But before we lived there I used to hate night clubbing.

I see the appeal as everyone meets everyone who goes to a nightclub as it's a big release to dance and so on. However, I do believe that if we didnt have social media we would still be meeting in pubs and bars. 

With a pub you can sit down and talk to people, actually make a connection with them. You can drink and not pay too much for it either. Live bands and jukebox throughout the week.

He used to be a fully developed character; a hardass with a comedic undertone who was frequently misunderstood by the kids but ultimately showed them learning was important, etc. He had depth. He doesn't even act like Mr. Ratburn!

And what on earth kind of wedding was that? Everyone abruptly sits down, someone plays the cello for 2 seconds, then they walk down the aisle and that's it? Sure, I could see if it was a 60 second Vegas wedding but it's clearly a formal affair. Suckiest ceremony ever - at least show us some context or backstory! How did they meet? How long have they been together? Delve into their relationship a bit - you can't just throw a whole freaking husband into a season premiere with no other lead up.

"Tittyfucking is Fraud, Plain and Simple","Coffee and popcorn smell better than they taste. Fine cheese tastes better than it smells. 

With that in mind, I feel like tittyfucking has a spot on the coveted go-to sex moves list that is wholly unearned and flat out fraudulent. It simply looks better than it feels, in an unforgivable way. Tittyfucking is packaged and sold as a comparable experience, but it doesn’t hold an erotic candle to a blowie or old fashioned HJ. 

The mechanics are faulty at best. Full disclosure, I prefer busty ladies. It’s just who I am. Even so, being properly TF’d without embarrassing and perhaps painful slippage has been a unicorn. My white whale. Even girls with D cups don’t seem to have the mass to properly and securely envelop the shaft for smooth, uninterrupted motions. That’s not saying I’m hung, my penis is very average, I promise you. It just seems like women need watermelon sized flotation devices to achieve effect without an onslaught of mood-killing EBE’s (Early Breast Exits). 

You can imagine my frustration. On paper, tittyfucking should be a home run. It should be the vaccine for polio. In action, however, tittyfucking is like Dr. Sebi’s AIDS cure. Promised to work wonders but leaves you unsatisfied. 

I won’t give up on tittyfucking, I will persevere and navigate these dark days. I just want to blow the lid off this conspiracy, and I finally have the courage to speak out and declare tittyfucking for what it really is. It’s no better than Communism.

If people can say that the reason the suicide rate among transexuals is so high because of the way society treats them. Then its perfectly acceptable to apply the same logic to suicide among men,"This is not to shit on transexuals by any stretch. But I hate when certain people keep saying the transsexuals have a high suicide rate Because of the way cis people treat them. Maybe there is a lot of truth to it. You can't deny transphobia exists. But simaltaneously in the western world suicide among men in twice as common among women. Is that to say that society treats men worse than women if we are applying the same logic that we do to transexuals. By this logic men are much more oppressed than women. 

Edit: I just wanted to clarify my intentions behind this post. It has a bit of a double meaning so to say. The main aim of this post isn't to say that men or women (and other groups) are the most oppressed. It was more to highlight how we use simplify a statistic to the point where we don't consider multiple reasons for it (in this case high suicide among transsexuals). I wanted to say that if we use such an approach to male suicide rate one by such ""incomplete"" logic. Conclude that men just as transgenders are one of the most oppressed groups.

I do love the people from Pakistan just like how I love the people from England where I reside. I have a strong passion and deep love for both countries. 

However, no matter how hard life gets, I am utterly grateful that I live in a country where I can freely express myself, live in safe and favourable conditions with no fear, have access to good health, and live in a place where there is a roof above me much unlike how my parents grew up when they were young. I have an immense gratitude of England and the rest of Europe in general and it pains me and angers me deeply when I see some people passionately hating the West.

Although most immigrants I know deeply appreciate their life in the West, there are a few who swear at the West so much, that I would go as far as to say they don’t even deserve to live here. In my eyes, they are some of the worst human beings on earth. But even that is the beauty of England. You can criticize it as much as you want and still live here.

Yes, there is some irrational hatred of immigrants solely based on their skin colour that is growing recently, and that should be condemned since it’s racist.

"Funerals are a waste of time, money and resources.","**It appears the message of my post may have gotten lost in translation somewhere in the text. I would like to clarify.**  


*I am perfectly okay with funerals. Casket, open-casket/ viewing, decent burials, etc.   It's the excessive extravagance that we slap onto these ceremonies, just for the stuff to then go to waste. That I don't get.*   


Disclaimer: I have only been to one memorial/ funeral (I'm unsure if there's a distinction) and even so, we were only permitted to be there partially.  M grandfather's funeral was a fairly simple affair since he was cremated, and there wasn't much by way of memorial. Just a simple table at the church with a few photos of him. This unpopular opinion is about the non-cremated dead

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm in the minourity here, but.. I've come to be very confused about funerals. I just don't get it. Yes, respect the dead. Give them some respect (to a point). Don't be disrespectful, I agree.

But the whole process of a funeral? What even is the point of that? I understand if some people wish to pay respects to a body (even if it's just an empty shell now), but we waste so many resources on these... for lack of a better term, death ceremonies. We're spending tens of thousands of dollars on Caskets! Body preservations! SUITS, MAKEUP AND CLOTHES!

... Just to.. you know... shut the lid on the box and bury the damn thing completely, never to be seen or touched again. All of that preparation taken. All of that money spent. Just to.. throw a corpse in a box and smother it in earth. Large caskets, carefully carved, wood-stained and sanded/ smoothed... fancy pillow for the lifeless corpse to put its head on and making it seem 'bed-like'. The corpse actually having had people take the time to dress it, and cover it in makeup to hide the usual deathly pallor.We even have the body preserved!! But... literally -why-? We're going to see the dead body maybe... one last time and that's it.

To Reiterate and be clear: I agree that we should to a point, give a modicum of respect for the dead. Don't just toss a dead body naked in a ditch. But to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a funeral, casket, and such? That just feels.. gaudy and incredibly wasteful. Particularly when one realizes that you just spent all that money, just to literally have it buried under several feet of dirt (or mud, depending on if its rainy).",unpopularopinion

If you drizzle ketchup over your fries rather than dipping them then you don't love yourself.,"I dont know when, how, or who conceived the notion that this is acceptable behaviour. Ketchup and fries is a sacred meal time experience and if you're pouring ketchup over the fries you're a disgrace to humanity.

With the drizzle method you end up with too much ketchup on top and not enough ketchup to compliment the fries at the bottom. You may think its okay to just reapply ketchup after you eat through the first layer but then you're just using more ketchup than necessary.

Dipping is the way it was meant to be because you not only can you control the amount of ketchup you have on each fry but also how it is applied.

Par example, you can simply dip and get a good sized glob on the end or you can smear and have a conservative but evenly applied amount of ketchup.

"I believe it should be illegal, with very limited exceptions, to fire someone for something they said or did outside of the workplace.","I am so glad I found this forum, as I think I have something to contribute!  This always gets downvoted when I'm arguing elsewhere so I think it would fit in here.

Lately there's been a whole lot of posts on Reddit, and elsewhere, where ""oh look this guy said the N word on Twitter and a bunch of people called up his work and he got fired, let's all laugh nazi tears QQ!""  No matter how despicable someone's views are, something about this, and the celebration of it, doesn't sit right with me.

This isn't so much about trying to protect people that say racist shit on Twitter.  This is about workplace protections for employees, how much of bullshit ""at-will employment"" really is, and wanting to see all employees essentially carry what amount to union protections currently.

I work in a job that has these protections.  Trust me, there are many things you can do that will get you fired, and there are some things that you can do outside the workplace that will still get you fired.  Thing is, that list is very clear-cut with little if any wiggle room.

Did you commit a felony?  Yeah, you're gone regardless of when or where.

Did you commit a misdemeanor, but it was something related to your line of work?  Yeah, that's enough to fire.  Like...if you're an accountant but you get busted for fraud, or retail and you were caught shoplifting from Kohl's or something.  Because it's specifically related to your daily duties it's enough to let go of someone.

But beyond that, you're not going to get fired.  Did you get in a fight with some guy at a bar over the weekend and get locked up?  Okay, you'll get called an idiot, but you're not going to face disclipline at work over it (nor should you.)

There's also a very clear-cut social media policy.  If it's on a forum that's run by the employer, they can discipline you based on what you said.  If it's on the internet anywhere, but you did it from a company device, or on company time, they can nail you.  But outside of work, outside of the employer's forum, and off of company-issued devices?  Nope, you can't be touched for it (unless it breaks one of the above felony/misdemeanor rules, which is usually pretty hard to do on social media.)

""But what about fields that hold someone to a higher standard, like lawyers or doctors or police?  They'd look horrible if they had to continue to employ someone that went on some bigoted rant!""

And I get that, which is why the employer should get some outs - but nothing as easy as ""oh, we just get to say you don't work here any more because we feel like it and you made us look bad.""  We're giving way too much power to SJWs and internet mobs by allowing for doxxing to have an instant life-ruin effect on someone, even if the person is an asshole.

Morality clauses in contracts are fine in some cases - but NOT as a ""you agree to this to get the job.""  It should run more like ""okay, we're paying you $x/hour for your normal time, and an additional smaller $x/hour, ABOVE your standard salary, as an expectation that you are still 'on the clock' and will not do anything that would bring us into disrepute.""  Alternatively, if a company doesn't want to go that route, and wants to do it on a reactionary basis, a severance clause could come into play.  Something that says ""Okay, we don't want you here, but you haven't done anything or done enough at work for us to have a reason to fire you, so we want out.  So we're going to pay you $XXX,XXX, which will be enough for you to get yourself situated in another job, or move to another location.""  Whether it be upfront saying ""we expect more and we'll pay for it"" or after the fact, regardless of which it should NOT BE FREE for an employer to fire someone unless workplace misconduct or one of the above rules about criminal acts can be proven.

If the job in question is one of those high-profile jobs where there's millions of dollars to be lost from a PR fiasco, these are exactly the jobs where they should be able to cut a six-figure check to have someone leave and still be able to turn to the people complaining about whatever the idiot said on social media and say ""They don't work here any more.  Are you happy now?""

On a similar note, if someone is under a contract to produce work, and the contract doesn't have a per-hour morals clause, and the employer wants to sever ties, they should have to pay out as if the person under contract completed all work on the contract.  To have an easy example, Roseanne Barr should have been paid for all remaining episodes/seasons under contract even though her series was cancelled.

Right now it's really easy for people to be okay with swarms to get people fired who say really reprehensible things, because those swarms are going after the ""right"" people.  (After all, beholdthemasterrace IS doxxing, or doing the bare minimum to appear like they're not, but they DO dox, and the sub should be banned for it, but it won't because who's going to go against the people that are pointing out figurative and sometimes literal Nazis?)  It's easy now.  But let's look at another extreme that's constantly in Reddit news.  China's new Social Credit system.  Oh, you play video games too much, or you get caught littering or smoking?  We're revoking your right to hold certain jobs, or rent luxury hotels, or fly first-class, or even get a plane ticket at all.  By being okay with firing people for off-work behavior, that sets a precedent that you're never truly separated from your employer.  And eventually that line's going to move, and it's going to result in decisions that aren't as easy.  It's not going to go from ""let's get racists fired"" to ""let's control every aspect of someone's life for the sake of the country/employer"" like China is doing overnight, but gradually I could see where we could end up having someone get axed from a job because they posted about drinking too much, or posted a clip of them shouting ""get fucked"" when they kill someone in Call of Duty or something that is currently considered pretty mundane.

That's why I want to see laws that protect workers similar to what Europe has, for everyone in the US.  It might protect a few assholes, but it'll probably protect way more people who aren't assholes later on.

Porn has ruined an entire generation's sexuality and needs to be prohibited,"I really feel that porn has irrevocably ruined an entire generation's sexuality, especially young men under 30. 30 years prior, porn was pictures of women lightly clothed in Playboy Magazines. Porn today?

It's all about

- choking women

- ramming a dick into women's vaginas as hard as possible

- dominating women and giving a false impression of women wanting to be dominated and submissive all the time

- promotion of incest porn and violent porn

- promotion of ""girl and daddy"" porn that freakishly resemble sexual acts between under age women and older men

- women being covered in jizz, now seen as a ""normal"" sex act and something women should be tolerant of or they're seen as prudes

- men believing anal sex is to be expected and women who don't conform to it are prudes

- women having their vaginal lips surgically removed and somehow seen as the ""the normal"" vagina to the extent that more and more young women go through with such surgery

- women having their vaginas totally shaven, a new concept that has impacted how men and women view female sexuality

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that women exist only to pleasure men, and that their sexuality and pleasure don't matter

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that all women find sexual acts common in porn as something enjoyable, which makes men believe they don't have to ask or be informed about what women find arousing and pleasurable


And so much more. Honestly porn is one of the great public health crisis of our time and needs to be treated at such. If you enter pornhub or any random pornsite, it's flooded by extreme porn like incestporn or violent porn that includes some kind of slapping, beating, choking of women and people act surprised that men think this is what all women wants in reality. 

Since parents don't want to talk to their children about how harmful porn is (most find it embarrassing), this cannot be resolved with education. Many parents are ignorant of how huge the problem is and some don't want to adress it. The porn crisis can only be solved by prohibiting it, and minimizing it's influence on young men and women.

This thread will now be downvoted or flooded with men who can't accept the realities of porn and how harmful it is to society because they've been brainwashed by all the porn they've been viewing daily since they were 10. They don't care about the well being of women, what matters is getting of and getting of is more important than prohibiting harmful stereotypes that upholds institutional misogyny in society.

Edit: Just to clarify. I'm not a prude or sex negative. People are free to do engage in whatever consensual sex act they find pleasurable. I'm critical of the normalisation of extreme porn. Some women do enjoy having their vaginas rammed, jizz in their face, being submissive etc. Notice ""some women"". Todays porn gives out the message that ALL women like these acts and that ALL women should be treated like this by default. Young people aren't emotionally and neurologically developed to understand the nuances of sexuality, which todays porn is missrepresenting.

It isnt fair that smokers get regular breaks during work.,"I don't know if it's the same in other countries, but in the UK anyone who smokes is allowed to have regular breaks from work in order to go out and smoke. I don't understand how this is considered fair: not only are they getting rewarded for damaging themselves, the environment, and people around them, but people who don't smoke aren't allowed extra breaks. I think either smokers shouldn't be allowed these breaks, or non-smokers should be allowed them as well

Just because a guy isn’t comfortable with his girlfriend/wife being revealing doesn’t make them controlling.,"Some people actually just don’t want the world to see what they have. Maybe it’s having a “Type” but I like having a girl who isn’t comfortable showing so much because that’s where feeling special comes to mind. It makes me feel special. I don’t judge the girls who do reveal themselves more than others I just don’t prefer it for my significant other and that’s something that you should know before you get into the relationship. Call it insecurity or controlling but I won’t force a girl to cover herself but it’s not something I would like to turn the other way to. And before the comments say anything about it being “vice versa” I am very secure of myself when it comes to revealing. If they’re fine with it or not I will not show myself around for anyone to see what is sacred for my woman. Sorry if this offends anyone just had to get that off of my chest for the simple fact that everyone is literally going around and shouting “CONTROLLING” “INSECURITY” all because their boyfriend didn’t want them to wear only thongs and lingerie bras to a rave.




Edit: so someone commented but deleted their comment before I could reply so I’ll repeat what was said. It was something along the lines of “it is insecurity and not so much preference, maybe you should re-evaluate your way.. and no one is “yours to begin with” or something like that sorry I can’t remember well but I know it offended me because of the word “re evaluate” and this was my response:

“Do you know a relationship is a duo thing. A partner thing where it’s not just about you anymore it’s about the both of you. I don’t get into relationships for fun. My goal is to marry and if that isn’t yours then that’s fine I guess do whatever you want. But it’s not longer inviting me to a party it’s inviting us. We come as a group. Have you ever heard someone call another person their other half? Are you going to call them wrong and say that “well they’re not yours” it’s a figure of speech. Where does a relationship draw the line? Because they’re not “yours” literally, means they can go out and cheat? And it be okay because they’re not yours? No. There’s certain things you expect in a relationship and sorry if you disagree or feel offended but it’s not something I need to work on. If I feel like I don’t want my significant other to be revealing that’s my choice, just as it is vice versa if they don’t want a significant other who cares about what they wear. It has EVERYTHING to do with preference. It’s not controlling it’s not insecurity it’s preference. If I choose not to be with a girl because I don’t want to deal with that topic then that’s okay and I’m not obligated to change my ways because someone wants me to adapt to their life if they can’t adapt to mine.”",unpopularopinion

Gillette razors deserve the coming boycot,"In case you have not seen it, they just released a video where they use #metoo to shit all over men. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0

But where is Gillette's outrage when it comes to:

In education girls are leaving boys behind. In nearly all states more girls finish high school than boys. Women are now the majority of university students, and earn the most bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

Men are also at a disadvantage after school. Research shows that they get fewer job interviews with the same qualifications as women. For example, if a male meet 40% of the job requirements, he has a 5% chance of getting an interview. Whereas a similarly qualified woman has an 11% chance of getting an interview. 

When it comes to being crushed, mutilated, electrocuted or killed at work, men are at a distinct disadvantage. Most backbreaking, dangerous jobs are done by men. The Labour Department reports that nearly 5,000 American workers die from workplace accidents each year, 90% of these deaths are men. 

Criminal justice: A study by the University of Michigan, found that men receive sentences that are 63% higher, on average, than females for exactly the same crime. Women are also less likely to be arrested, more likely to get a suspended sentence and are released earlier on parole than men. 

What about unwanted pregnancies? Here women have all the choices, while men have zero. A woman can give the baby up for adoption or even have an abortion, without the father’s consent. If she decides to keep the baby, the father must pay child support for 18 years, even if he earns very little. A 2007 Urban Institute study on child support, found that 70% of fathers who could not pay, had to pay, on average, 83% of their monthly salary for child support. If a father cannot pay what the court ordered him to pay, he will be send to jail. A 2009 study in South Carolina found that 13.2% of male prisoners were behind bars for non-payment of child support 

In America almost 50% of all marriages end in divorce. More than 70% of these divorces are initiated by the wife, with the main reason given, “being unhappy in the relationship”.  Not only will men lose half of their property in a divorce, they must also pay alimony and child support to their ex-wives for many years. Men losing their homes in divorce proceedings, is one of the main reasons why nearly 80% of all homeless people in the US are men.

Custody: Divorced women are also more likely to get the children.  In fact, between 68% to 88% of the time they will get custody, depending on the state, mainly because courts view women as “better” parents. 

Life expectancy: On average, men die 5 years earlier than women, due to stress and worse life conditions. Yet, women retire earlier than men in most states.  

When we look at all of these factors, is it any wonder that almost 80% of all suicides are committed by men?

But no it is ""men who have to be better"". Fuck YOU Gillette.",unpopularopinion
Currently the biggest social mistake my generation has made is the way we treat boys.,"Hello r/unpopularopinion,

Every generation has that one thing that they look back on and kind of say “whoops” that was a big problem that we didn’t see/ we didn’t do anything about. I think that thing is how we have treated boys in my generation (late millennial's). I think the writing has been on the wall for a while but nothing seems to happen. I of course mean socially not all of the pollution and terrible way we treat the planet. Let me elaborate.

I believe we live in a reactionary society I.E a kid gets hit in a street and the city decides to build a massive speed bump to overcompensate for the issue. Applying this to how women were treated previously and you kind of get the idea.  I believe a good portion of our issues plaguing our society ( in the US. Mental health, gun violence in schools, suicide, homelessness, drug addiction etc..) currently can be traced back to the difference in how boys/men are treated.  Boys from a very young age are told their lives are worth less than their female counterparts, they are taught to hold in their emotions not to talk about the issues plaguing them leading to mental health issues, going to war and dying in another country is virtuous, they should hold women on a pedestal etc..

I mean all the statistics look really bad.

1. Men/boys are way more prone to suicide ( yes I know girls are more likely to attempt but boys are 3 times as likely to follow through)
2. graduating college at a much lower rate than women (in the US)
3. Ridiculously high incarceration rates and longer sentences compared to women for the same crime.
4. You are ridiculously more like to be a Drug addict/ homeless.
5. Literally some states have zero domestic violence shelters that will allow men in…. (Seriously they won’t allow men in but will allow dogs.)
6. Very little paternity rights compared to women.
7. And one of the worst things is not being able to talk about any of these issues for fear as being seen as weak

&amp;#x200B;

This all kind of stemmed from me recently talking to my dad and discussing why I was raised so different than my 2 sisters not really mad or anything more just curious as I always had harsher punishments/more chores/ less acknowledgement and overall was probably less involved in my family then my sisters. He said something along the lines of “I know it wasn’t right and wasn’t fair but no one gives a shit about a man and me and your mother decided we needed to prepare you for that inevitability of life.” I’m not mad or angry in fact in some ways it probably helped me as I am pretty successful right now and happy but it still got me thinking, I’m sure a lot of Men were raised similarly.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really a men’s right activist or anything or a women hater ( I am currently in a very happy 3 year relationship with my girlfriend)  but the more I grow up the more I see issues in how I was raised and how society perceives men and how that leads to a bunch of issues we are currently facing in society. Just my 2 cents.",unpopularopinion

The cream in Oreos is the worst part of Oreos.,"It doesn't have may vanilla flavour or if it does it is very much over powered by the amount of sugar it has. The texture is like a booger to me and after eating 2 Oreos my mouth feels like it is covered in fat and grease because that's what the cream basically is: a glorified sugar and fat mix.
The cream is so sweet that it even overpowers the great taste of the biscuit.
When eating Oreos with a glass of milk the cream is still this thick gooey mass that ruins the great combination of the biscuit and milk.

Personally I take the cream off before eating BUT it is stuck so badly that I cannot take it off completely. And any bit of residue gives you the same experience as taking a stick of butter, dipping it in sugar and then taking a good bite out of it.

Masturbation / Jerking Off is and should be a profession sport and in the olympics,"Hear me out here - This sport isn’t like the other sports. It would test the durability, patience, and strength of a man. Nobody realizes how tough it is to jerk off for 10 straight minutes without busting a nut. That’s why we should have the absolute professionals all do it in one place on Tv. I don’t think it would be nsfw, we can just keep the camera on the pools of cum on the ground.  Jerking off is a very tough test and requires a lot of concentration, and I have plenty of ideas for this.

**Name**

Professional Jerking / Jerking

**How the game is played**
I think professional jerking can have many different concepts, so let’s just set this is for the *Olympics*.  We bring 50 of the worlds best masturbaters, and bring them into the arena. Think about it, the lights and sounds, the chants, as we prepare for the first profession jerking. 

We start with round 1, the players get to chose what they want to watch and the clock stars 20 minutes down, every player has to jerk with condiments of there choice. Last one to nut wins. First five to nut are eliminated. Then, we do it again with a 20 minute break for advertisements and to regenerate nut power, as we go on to round 2. 

We repeat the process over and over, until we reach a final 5. Last one standing. Now they have to jerk to each other. *First* to nut wins. As they watch their same gender opponents and try as hard as possible to jerk to their sweaty, white dicks, with how gay it is, they have to bust. First one to cum wins.

*League*
It’s be call the PJL.- Professional jerking league, and the league subreddit would be r/ProfessionalJerking.

That is all. I have a dream that this could happen  one day. Sorry in advance for any formatting issues i’m on mobile

If you define yourself by your sexuality or gender identity then you're an uninteresting person.,I'm tired of hearing about people flaunting their gender identity as if it was in any way interesting. By all means. Fight for equal rights(even though I think equality is impossible). Everyone deserves to be treated with neutral politeness until they do something against your personal set of beliefs.. But if you take your identity or sexuality or whatever word is used for things outside the basic binary of sex chromosomes(minus mutations like hermaphroditism) and that becomes central to who you are? The most important thing about you as a person? Then good gods you must be boring. Sure. Some of it is desensitization I suppose. Throw it in peoples faces until they stop caring. But what you are is so unimportant in the scheme of things compared to what you could say or accomplish. I don't really see why someone would choose something as unimportant as gender as the thing to define themselves by and I tend to think less of people who do this. The only time I think your gender and sexuality should matter is when you're dealing with a potential mate.,unpopularopinion
"If you are an immigrant and complain about 'white people', 'white rules', or 'white washed immigrants' you should either shut up or go back","I'm an immigrant, and I'm accused all the time of acting 'too white'.

Yes, all countries have issues, but when these immigrants specifically complain about how bad western countries are because of it's 'westerness', I can't help but wonder, why the fuck did they come here? It could be that I don't see the other side, but many immigrants in East Asia love the East Asian culture and don't complain about it being 'too asian'. 

When immigrants go to a new country and try to change things, it just sounds so stupid. There are plenty of immigrants from the middle east that want women to be more 'modest'. Sure, they may be a minority, but I see a huge problem with immigrants complaining about the 'whiteness' of the country, not just middle easterns. 'Westerners are too sexual.' Don't have sex with a westerner then. Go back to your country.  I know people hate the 'go back to your country spiel' and I agree we shouldn't willy nilly throw that phrase around, but when people are saying how bad it is 'here because it's white' then yes, I think they should go back.

"Not being married with kids later in life is nothing to be ashamed of, and people who criticize single older people are shallow and insensitive.","Aggressive Edit: To all you people saying “op you’re lame this is too popular to exist”, before this got popular this post was a cesspool of disagreement and agreement alike. Because Reddit is made up of a ton of nerds and outcasts, of course there will be a lot of people who think this way. That’s not how most of society views it though, so don’t be fooled by what the user base deems popular on this one website. Peace 😎.

Marriage and relationships in general are not for everyone. I’ll use myself as an example. For work, I am on call 24/6 with a minimum of 8 hours rest between shifts. I get one day off per week and I don’t know what that day will be until the prior week. If I were married or in a relationship with that kind of schedule, the relationship would be greatly strained. Not to mention my kids, if I had any, would not have a dad for much of their childhood. It wouldn’t be fair to them to be skimped out of experiences because I always had to work.

Despite that, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been criticized for not having a family or spouse at my age. Look, not everyone has to conform to societal norms. I love my job and I don’t want to go through heartbreak and depression because I tried to be a typical American family man and it didn’t work out. It’s very shallow of other people to think this when they are not in my shoes. I’m trying to think of what is best for myself and a possible family, so don’t sit there and say “you’ll regret it later on in life”.

Drake is a woefully overrated artist,His hits are good at surface level observation. However I have friends who proclaim him to be the greatest rapper of all time. His albums (especially of late) are a complete slog to get through and are packed with filler to beef streaming numbers. His personality seems super forced and fabricated to “relate” to people. His lyrics are generally not very interesting-listening to a drake album in headphones and actually breaking down what he is talking about is just not as enthralling of an experience as listening to many other rappers in the game currently and before him: rappers who many would totally scoff at naming an all time great. I think there are at least 20 rappers better than he is making music right now. He chocks his albums with filler to bump his streaming numbers and is basically in it for commercial appeal and money as I see it. He also came across as scared and just completely in over his head in the beef against Pusha T. I am tired of a house party rapper with lyrics tailor made for girls to quote in a night out Instagram caption being hailed as a top 5 or even top 1 rapper OF ALL TIME.

It’s especially frustrating to me because I was bullied and even beaten relentlessly about my interest in things like computers and Warhammer 40k, and nowadays I see those same people who made me feel worthless over those things trying to jump on the bandwagon.

Hunters do more for conservation and the ecosystem than any other group.,"I have an anti-hunting co-worker who doesn't like my logic, which prompted this post. Hunters pay almost $800 million per year in licensing, permits and fees. Hunters donate approximately $400 million per year to organizations for conservation. Hunters pay an 11% tax through the Pittman Robertson Act on hunting gear, guns, ammo, etc., which generates another almost $400 million per year. On top of that, they hunt animals according to regulations (there are poachers - each group has some assholes in it, right?) that are put in place by biologists whose career is literally to determine how many of a species SHOULD be hunted to create the best habitat for these animals. If hunters don't kill a certain number of deer, turkeys, ducks, etc., the ecosystem cannot maintain, they would eat more than nature can hold and would ultimately cause more problems by drifting into neighborhoods (for those of you who hit one with your car, this would happen more) and would die of starvation due to lack of food source. The people in states that have banned hunting because of public outcry don't realize that now instead of having hunters participate and pay money in taxes and fees etc. to the state, the state now hires people to kill the same amount of animals in order to keep a sustainable level (i.e., California and black bears). Instead of raising money, they are now using taxpayers money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for those that think hunters are only after trophies, that's incorrect. Hunters usually take animals that have bred the most and are older in life, making room for younger generations to breed. This happens to be those with the biggest antlers, as that's a sign of an older buck/bull. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that attack hunters who go overseas to take big game, they are paying usually in the tens of thousands, if not more, in order to have that hunt. Those programs are specifically put into place to take out an old aggressive animal (already picked prior to paying for your hunting tag) and to give that local government enough money to continue to pay for conservation throughout the year. Hunters are not waltzing off into the desert and killing a bunch of lions on a whim. People need to be more educated prior to making bold statements like hunting is bad.

tl;dr - hunters pay more for conservation than any other group; hunting is necessary to keep amount of animals at bay to sustain for the future.",unpopularopinion

Never mind the fact that you have to pay for this ghastly experience which could also potentially hearing loss because of how loud the music is, which is unbearable anyway regardless of volume because of how crap it is.

TLDR: Clubs suck.  


Edit: Wow, so much hate (the incel accusations in particular), but thank you to those who didn't take my opinion personally.   


Just to clarify a couple of things. First, I am not against drinking or alcohol. If you read my post carefully, I said you can do this in a ""controlled environment"". What I meant by this were places where you're not exposed to some of the excesses of clubbing, such as loud noise, drugs and, it must be said, overly drunk people who sometimes can become violent.  


Secondly, just because I think clubbing is overrated doesn't mean I have always had this opinion. Some people rightly pointed out that I must be over 25, which I am, but I'd like to think my opinion now is more informed (nevertheless, it is only an opinion). That's because, believe it or not, I did used to go clubbing, particularly during my teenage years. Like many teenagers, I had my share of fun at the time and I can see the appeal. You are exposed to new people, free of the chains of your parents and the law (you can finally drink alcohol). And yes, it can provide a fertile atmosphere to get off with someone, particularly if you already know him/her. But I think the novelty wears off and a lot of people in this thread have pointed this out.   


What I find troubling though is how many people in this thread have suggested that clubs are the only environment where you can meet and connect with people, which I can only say is totally ignorant and perhaps suggests people struggle with their confidence outside clubs. To paraphrase one person in this thread ""women don't want to be approached in places outside clubs"", such as coffee shops, supermarkets, parks, or whatever. This is a bit rich coming from people who have said I am insular, but if you truly hold this opinion then I think you are the one who is not fully experiencing the world. Sure, people (women in particular) don't EXPECT to be approached outside clubs like they do when in clubs, but that doesn't mean they won't be open to talking to you if you make an impression. Personally, I have met some very interesting people in unexpected places who went on to become good friends of mine.",unpopularopinion

I clearly actively dislike her. That being said, I don’t find the need to make it clear to *her* how much I dislike her and still try to treat her with respect. I would never tell her any of the things I wrote here.

I am of the opinion that my issues with her are solely mine and I don’t find it necessary to treat her differently just because I can’t stand her.

The “privilege” I have as a white male isn’t universal. Ethnic groups from all races and ethnicities have been oppressed and discriminated against for the entire existence of the United States. Groups of people who are white, Asian, black, and Native American have all had brutal discrimination towards them, I do not argue that any one race had it worse than blacks nor am I discounting what has had to be overcome, I’m simply highlighting that white privilege was not and is not universal in the US for generations as Korver said and therefor I should not be held responsible for the racism of others committed in the past and present.",unpopularopinion

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas believe that video games can never tell a story better than movies can. They say that picking up a controller instantly makes it less immersive. I disagree. I’ve watched many a movie in my time and have never felt like I’m experiencing the same thing the character is, but as soon as I start playing a game like red dead redemption 2, gears of war, or cod: modern warfare, I’m much more immersed. Having control of the character puts you more in their perspective and the choices you get to make can have a serious impact on the story. Everything from the music to the voice acting to the character development and background has made video games a better medium for story telling even if a lot of games don’t use it to its fullest potential.

"The ""believe the victim always"" idea scares me.","Please read. 

I am in no way saying victims of sexual harassment/racism/sexism should not speak up. They should feel like their accusations are being treated fairly and should not be reprimanded for coming forward. Every accusation should be investigated. 

Most accusations are true. However, I as a public school teacher am terrified of what a blanket siding with the victim could mean for my profession. I am fairly new to teaching and want to never do anything else with my working life. I am only in my 5th year and have already heard horror stories of teachers being wrongly accused of inappropriate relationships with students that were deemed in a court of law to be not guilty. The problem is, their verdict is never as well publicized as their accusation. These teachers can almost never teach again, and some can't get jobs even outside of teaching. 

In my 5 years, I have been accused of racism by an upset student. Luckily, other teachers were in the room and we resolved it immediately, but how hard wouldn't be with today's technology to fake a text conversation or email between a student and me and share it with a news media or get it trending? I already have lawsuit happy parents who are so past any semblance of morality that this seems reasonably plausible that this could happen once considering I have 30 years left and about 100 new students a year.  

I am not a core subject teacher. I teach a subject where I can teach a student from 6th grade to 12th grade, and we spend a lot of time practicing after school, sometimes in small groups. I was essentially taught in college to be paranoid of being alone with a student for any length of time, especially in your first 10 years of teaching, because all it takes is an accusation.

It's not ok for 4500 random people to march up to a country's border and demand entry.,"No we don't owe you anything and if you want to come into our country that's fine, but we have rules and a process for that and you need to be vetted. We need to know who you are, what your history is, background checks, confirm your story etc. But don't demand entry like you're entitled.

Edit: To all the people saying it's ok to walk up to a border and request asylum, you're right. But watch the videos on YouTube showing how these people crossed into Mexico. They didn't request asylum. A mob of people tore down the border fence and flooded through. What do you think they'll do when they get to our border? That's not how you request asylum. That's an invasion.

Edit: to all the people quoting the statue of liberty, yeah I know what it says. But you're missing the point. I'm not against immigration. Again, we have a process for it and it doesn't involve flooding through our border like that.

It is not racist or sexist to want historical accuracy in historically set videogames.,"Lately, especially on reddit I see many people think its racist and sexist to stand up for historical accuracy in movies and videogames. This seems to be driven a lot by the sub gamingcirclejerk where every second post now is ""dae all gamers hate women and minorities""? That whole argument is built upon a ridiculous strawman. Are there some racist idiots out there in the crowd that wants historical accuracy? Yes. There are. But they are a small minority. It isnt in any way or form in itself racist or sexist to want historical accurate representation in videogames, if its a historically set game. I *love* when historical games and movies go that extra inch to try to portray real history because it helps the immersion so much. It is true that most historically set games arent 100% accurate anyway, but why should they continue to be washed out with *even more* inaccurate portrayal and even further towards fantasy, if their initial goal was a historic setting? Most other artforms and genres already have fantasy elements so why cant we have some genres try to at least strive for accuracy, even though it may never be 100% accurate? Why make it even more intentionally historically inaccurate because ""its not 100% accurate anyway""?

Example: if a game takes place in a time in history where only whites where around at that location and setting, I want only whites. If a game takes place in history where only blacks where around at that location, I want only blacks. If I play a Yakuza game I want only japanese people and no white or black people in the game. If I play a fictional war game set in the Congo jungle I want only blacks unless whites where there at that time. If I am in a prison in a game I want only male inmates assuming its not a womens prison. I want the games to look like reality did. If you think that is racist or sexist against the particular group being excluded sorry but you are the nut.",unpopularopinion

Parents whose children die because of a preventable disease because they chose not to vaccinate should be charged with neglect and 3rd degree murder,"Title says it all. Personally I think that the anti-vaccination movement is absurd and it sickens me that people will voluntarily let their child catch a life threatening disease that could easily have been avoided by getting a vaccination. Letting your child die to something preventable because you chose not to do it should be punished severely, and there should be lengthy jail terms and heavy fines to anyone that lets it happen. I know it seems pretty extreme, but it fits right under neglect, and letting someone die because of your actions (not to mention letting a child die) should, in this case, be treated as murder.

EDIT: I didn’t make this clear enough above and I apologize for that but my “end goal” with this isn’t actually to incarcerate people who have had their child die, but to tack on something more to the threat of what happens as if the movement has existed as long as it has and continues, the children who have died aren’t enough to get people to realize what they’re doing.

Fat girls are not inspirational or beautiful,"I’m so tired of seeing fat girls on Instagram, or anywhere really, having the same basic story. “She was bullied, told she was overweight and ugly. But she’s overcome that and become a model and look how beautiful she is”. Despite the fact that without editing she looks like a greasy blue whale. 

They are not beautiful or inspirational. Girls might not like it, but fatness is ugly. It says a lot about you as a person that you would let your body get like that and then let it stay like that. You are not beautiful or inspirational if you are fat. No one. And I repeat, no one wants wants to be you. People feel sorry for you because you put yourself in a position that puts you at a huge disadvantage. 

You are not beautiful or inspirational. You are dying. There is nothing beautiful or sexy about heart disease, diabetes, strokes, ankle tape, size H bras, multiple chins, intaking 3000 calories a day or the constant whining that you always direct towards skinny girls. 

Side note: Not talking about girls who are thick, that’s totally different. Having a curvy body shape is not the same as being fat. However the number of fat girls who claim to be “thicc” is absurd. There is such a massive gulf between girls who are thick and girls who are fat. It makes you look stupid to even think you’re thick if you’re actually just fat 😂",unpopularopinion

But the average guys who are probably depressed, lonely and relatively anti social.

Not everyone can be this charismatic, gregarious person and not everyone wants to. So when people tell men that looks don’t matter(an absolute lie) and reality blatantly reveals otherwise. Of course you’re going to begin resenting people. 

There’s a strong chance most incels are good hearted intelligent people who are frustrated, envious because they have difficulty cultivating OPTIONS. The most powerful tool in a man’s disposal while dating. IF a man isn’t naturally attractive(6ft+ beard decent face) to an abundance of women looks wise he will have to face constant rejection, bad dates and dry spells.

Wouldn’t you be angry as well? Many women have natural abundance from a young age. Of course this comes with its problems(creepy old men, weirdos and creeps in general) not denying that. 

But if you had to hit a target with a revolver or a machine gun which one is easier? 

Go fishing with a fishing rod or dynamite and a net?

There has been a plethora of books written for men trying to become more attractive to women. The internet has exploded and men have begun congregating about their difficulties dating, when similar trends appear from just observing life(“man tall guys sure do get a lot of women”, “man that cocky dude is beating them off with a stick”) you begin to harbor vitriol toward god, society, mankind, women and everything else. These people then form echo chambers and hate grows until terror attacks or whatever happen.(ahem sound like anything else?)

Men are kind of in a weird place right now, our traditional roles are changing, we are frustrated with dating and becoming more sexless and celibate, we live in a world of abundance with instant gratification at every corner many have lost their purpose and passion in life.

"If your girlfriend is bi, being intimate with other girls should be considered cheating","Saw a thread where the OP was getting territorial over his bi girlfriend cuddling and sleeping over with other girls. All the comments basically said ""get over it""

I said ""It should be considered equivalent to her cuddling and sleeping over with a guy, because she's attracted to both genders. talk with her and if she continues break things off""

BLASTED with downvotes, called a bigot and biphobic. 

I mentioned a situation where I was in a relationship with a bi girl and she made out with other girls when we were together. When I had a problem with it, she replaced me with another guy who'd be okay with watching her playing tonsil hockey with other girls. 

Replies just said things like ""good, I hope you go through situatuons like that for the rest of your life""

So... cheating is only okay if it's girl-on-girl? What kind of logic is this? If Im straight, date someone that's bi, I'm supposed to let her make out with other girls? If I'm bi, does that mean I get a free pass to make out with other dudes, and if my gf gets mad she gets called a bigot?

EDIT: Some comments have me confused. Being bi is perfectly fine. Having a relationship being bi is fine. I know a lot of bi people who don't cheat, and are happy. As long as you set your own boundaries that both of you consent to, even if you two agree you can make out with others.

All this post is about is the morons on reddit who think girl-on-girl or boy-on-boy actions are exclusively not cheating.

Bad guys need to prevail more often in movies/shows.,"I hate that in like 95% of movies, it’s just the protagonist overcoming some seemingly impossible odds to defeat the antagonist. It’s so predictable, overdone and mostly unrealistic. It takes away from the suspense because you know the good guy will prevail in the end.

One script that I really enjoyed was the Hunger Games series. Spoiler warning just in case. Now technically the good guys still won in this series, but it turned into quite a Pyrrhic victory in the end as the protagonists had to sacrifice so much to win, that the worthiness of the cause was up for debate by the end. I fuck with that shit honestly.

Another example would be Game of Thrones. Spoiler warning again. The Red Wedding? Loved that shit because it drew a new emotion that I hadn’t experienced in film before. To have such major protagonists like that so suddenly ripped away was more compelling than if they had lived imo.

I don’t know whether this opinion is unpopular or not but it seems to be with how often the protagonists prevail in film. I’d just like to see more variety in story lines, I feel like the hero overcoming insurmountable odds to enjoy a happy ending is just way too overplayed.

Jesus is either the most successful cult leader or the least successful savior of humanity.,"Cult leader:
1. 2.2b followers
2. Massive amount of money raised by his ideology
3. People give their lives to be saved by him
4. Beloved and accepted by most the world and even his main rivals see value in him
5. A legacy spanning thousands of years.

Least successful saviour:
1. None of his followers actually follow his advice 
2. Many completely disregard his advice and think you just have to go for a dip in water and you're good.
3. Nothing changed after he died holy men are still corrupt people still cling to wealth nobody helps the poor except for selfish reasons 
4. People use his teachings to justify their bad behaviour and paraphrase him to justify bigotry racism and nationalism 
5. He couldn't even save the Jews from their fate at Auschwitz at the hands of one of his followers 
6. Many have robbed him from his true belief and used his name to promote their personal agenda 
7. Many people celebrate a pagan holiday as his birthday and use his death as a reason to over indulge on chocolate 
8. His name is used to promote greed envy wrath and turn away from one of the commandments of God in the sense of modesty as the Bible says the first sin was for man to become aware of our nakedness and be shamed by it and god's plan for us was to inherit the earth and multiply 

Edit: Just a little context, the messiah in the jewish faith is actually the one who was supposed to save the world from religious hypocrisy and ""fulfil the law"" meaning, save all humanity from original sin. According to prophets, priests and pastors, sin still exists. None of us are saved unless we're baptised. (Something jesus didn't actually do until well after establishing his cult but people argue he didn't need to, because he was perfect. Even though all humans at this point had the sins of their fathers, he was perfect because god was his father. Though god himself never claimed to be perfect, this is an assumption.) We must go to church every sunday to eat bread as a tradition remembering him however originally this was a tradition brought over from the jewish faith, where the angel of death literally passed over egypt and liberated the jewish people from slavery by killing the first sons of egypt as a warning to their masters. It was not a weekly thing and Jesus was against tradition and standardized churches. So it's kind of ironic that this has become a thing. In that regard, Jesus kind of failed in his mission no matter how you look at it. He didn't clear anything up, or abolish any rules of tradition. If anything, his followers and by extension himself have only made more.

Edit 2: Grammar, spelling :)

Disclaimer: I have received a few questions and concerns and before my inbox gets too flooded with the same ones I thought I'd make an update here. A lot of you want to know my faith, I am religious and this post was written with love. I do not believe it was jesus' fault that religion has become so corrupt I think it is the fault of all those in religious power who abuse that authority and our own fault for desiring religion to be watered down for us. While many of you are from different sects to me I am more than happy to discuss your sect with you (or your lack of one / your choice to be atheist) I might do a part two with more detail so look out for that if you're interested. Also for the hitler point I hold my hands up and say it was a low blow but hitler did indeed maintain a facade of Christianity while he was in power and had ties with the church. It is my belief any church leader who did not outright condemn him turned their back on jesus and their faith and while that is an easy point for me to state in these times I believe the essence of Christianity to be doing the hard thing that's right, no matter what it cost you. Jesus died for you, the least you could do as a christian is do the same for him. If you are an atheist I fully support your decision. In the jewish faith their are many paths to god not all of them are religious live a good life and live it well and peace will be with you. There is too much fear in this world, if you're a person of love then I love you too.

"The ""Lorena"" documentary is disturbing because it paints a woman who cut off a man's penis as a victim whose action was understandable","And if she truly was abused and mistreated by her husband, which it really looks like she was, of course she had every right to defend herself. She should have filed a case against him. He should have been charged. The two would have separated ways and that would have been the end of it.

Hell if he really sexually assaulted her, I would have even understood it even if she had killed him in self defence. But to take away someone's genitals is just beyond horrific torture. I don't think that should have done that. In fact she went to his room when he was asleep and cut it off. And went out of her way to throw it into a field so it could not be recovered and re-attached. It was only later, after an extensive search, that they found what was left of the severed penis in a field and put it back. 

In [various articles written about the new documentary now](https://www.salon.com/2019/02/15/lorena-confronts-the-truth-about-the-bobbitts-and-how-america-failed-her/), Lorena is painted as the innocent victim. Never mind the fact that, regardless of what happened to her, she castrated a man and got away with it. She was never punished, only by public perception.

"Refusing to consider fat people when dating is not, nor will it ever be ""shallow"".","Often you'll hear fat people (usually women) complaining about how shallow everyone else is who refuses to date them or even find them physically attractive, based on their weight. The general argument tends to go along the lines of ""You should love a person for who they are on the inside, and not what they look like on the outside"". 

However, what many of them don't seem to realise is that by refusing to date them, it's about more than just their appearance - It's about their personalities and their lifestyles. Being fat is more often than not, a result of having a lack of self control. Yes, chances are they do care about their overall health and appearance, but usually not enough to willingly do something about it. 

Things like hiking, walking the dogs, or even spending a lot of time on your feet while travelling will be too much for them to handle, and they'll slow you down like all hell. Unless you each prepare your own meals, eating healthily goes out the window also, whether due to an increase in the amount of junkfood and takeaways being consumed, or even just home-cooked meals that are high in calories. 

Between the lack of exercise and increased caloric intake, chances are that you too, will also gain weight over time. You're potentially looking at a significantly shorter lifespan for not only yourself, but even possibly your future children, who will likely follow in the footsteps of their parents.

"Having a child with a severe mental disability is an irrational choice and a huge burden, and people who talk about how much they grow and appreciate from the experience are delusional.","Parents who choose to raise a child with a severe mental disability like Down's Syndrome  are making a terrible mistake from any rational perspective: they're committing to investing the rest of their lives in someone who may never be fully independent and will never reach the full potential that a mentally normal person will. This choice is especially terrible for families with other children: having one child who requires enormously more time and effort than the others is preposterously unfair and will drag on the other children for the rest of their lives.

That said, many people claim to find immense happiness, the true meaning of love, etc. from raising such a child. I think this is the definition of cognitive dissonance and self-delusion. All this experience is subjective of course, but does one not objectively get all the same benefits from raising mentally normal children without the immense pain and difficulty of intellectual disability? Who actually wants to lose so much time and liberty on a person unlikely to live to an old age or to have adult accomplishments or to be a contributing member of the community? We can learn to appreciate and grow from any  unfortunate situation in life; that doesn't mean that we should value that situation as a special or desirable one. 

But I feel like all of society is in on this delusion and reinforces it. We're supposed to give extra appreciation and thanks to the parents who make this commitment. We're supposed to adore and recognize severely mentally challenged people who accomplish menial tasks like being a door greeter, when a mentally-unchallenged person given the same upbringing and resources could be being a doctor or engineer and benefiting the lives of countless others.

My point is that, I found a way out the most unfit situations and so can anyone else. I was dealt a sh\*tty hand, but didn't allow that to hinder me.

Kids shirts with political messages are trashy regardless of what it says.,"We’ve all seen those shirts about vaccinations lately. People are critiquing those anti-vax parents for dressing their children in shirts that say “I’m unvaccinated. My superpower is giving people diseases I don’t have” or something similar. But when we see a shirt of a similar style that’s pro-vax (e.g. “I’m vaccinated because I leave the research to the professionals”) everyone wants one and says they’ll get them for their kids. 

I am absolutely for vaccinations, don’t get me wrong. I just think using your kid as a pawn to advertise your politics is kinda gross. That child usually isn’t old enough to have their own idea about what it says. You are only subjecting that kid to automatic judgement from others based on whether they agree with you, the parent. Why not just get cute kids shirts with child-appropriate captions?

"If you believe in free college, free healthcare and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration.","I just don’t understand it. You want to give people free healthcare, free food, free college and free guaranteed income and also let anyone who wants to, come here? You might as well just put piles of cash at the border. 

How do you expect a system like that to survive? Social welfare programs only work when enough of the population pays into them. If you’re offering all this “free” shit and allowing unskilled, uneducated people who don’t speak the language to flood into the country it will implode.

You’re telling the entire world that if you’re pregnant and can give birth here we will give your child free food, free college, free healthcare and free income for life.  Why would they not try to come here illegally? I don’t blame them, as future father with a baby due in September I would try and come here too. The fact is you can’t take care of the entire world. Just because you may want to doesn’t mean you can. 

If you believe in any combination of free healthcare, free college and guaranteed income you should have a zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration. Stopping illegal immigration is the only way these policies would have a chance of being sustainable. 

As a real world example Germany is currently paying immigrants to leave. They brought in over a million people in one year. They can’t speak the language, can’t work and have no where to live. They’re draining the social systems in Germany. So much so that it’s cheaper for Germany to pay them to leave. Germany is offering to pay one year of their rent if they get the fuck out.

"Modern feminism, ""boss babe"" and ""girl power"" culture is really patronizing, degrading, and it is counterintuitive to the main message that equality is supposed to represent.","I am a mid-20s female, and this mentality just drives me insane. I get where people are coming from, but it just sounds so infantilizing to have an entire ""movement"" based around this idea that women need reassurance that they're capable, powerful, and smart too. 

For example, I am a small business owner, and I find it frustrating when other businesses go out of their way to say they're ""woman-owned"". It's like, okay...great...good for you, I guess? Should I applaud you or something? It's not a woman-owned business. It's just a fucking business, get over yourself.

The thing is, I'm not oblivious to the struggles women have had in the past, and still have to some degree today. But at some point, equality is equality and it's entirely counterintuitive to your cause if you're making up all these special treatments for women. 

I want help and support because I asked, because I need it, because I deserve it (if, in whatever situation, I do deserve it. Sometimes we don't.). I don't want this weird, automatic, yet backhanded support just because I'm a female. 

Another thing I hate is when other women are like, ""It's your obligation as a female to support other females!"" Uhh no. I will support you if I believe in you and what you're doing. But just because we both share a commonality, doesn't mean our values automatically align.

Since I've had the experience of being an absolute unit, I can tell you that it sucks, it's gross and it shouldn't be defended or glorified.

Being fat like this is literally tiring. It's  embarrassing when I get on a plane or go to an arena with small seats and I can hardly fit in.  I start breathing heavy doing the most minimal of excercise.  I can feel it in my legs and knees getting up or going up stairs.  I eat too much too often and feel gross after.  Lastly, I know in my head I have to change my ways or I will have some medical complications down the road.

So having this lived experience, it drives me batty that people talk on the internet about body positivity in relation to obesity.  I'm not saying you should bully fat people into the ground, but it sure looks like it is being excused an awful lot.  This is bad for me and anyone else who just truly hasn't put their best effort into trying to control their diet and exercise.  

Instead of morally posturing about how fat shaming is bad, can we go the route of encourage healthy eating, benefits of exercise, encouraging accountability, etc.  I think it would be more beneficial for obese folks, including myself, to better understand the benefits of healthy exercise.  Stop white Knighting on every little negative comment about being overweight.

Sex scenes in movies are stupid and serve no purpose.,"First of all, i’ve never actually heard anyone say they like sex scenes in movies, just when the scene is taken out and even then, it’s just shitty porn. 

90% of the time, the sex adds nothing to the plot and could have easily just been implied and it wouldn’t have changed the movie. 

Really the only people who are happy about sex scenes in movies are horny guys who want to see their favorite actress’s upper cleavage and maybe even the full breast. yeah that’s nice when you don’t have to watch it with someone who is probably your family. 

tonight specifically, i was going to watch a movie with my sister and dad but they chose a movie i know has an explicit scene in it and i can’t fucking stand that and it makes me so uncomfortable. 

most of the arguments where people are like sex scenes are good go along the lines of “sex happens in real life and it’s natural and movies depict real life so they should show that.” first of all, there’s nothing different if you just imply the sex vs showing it, and secondly, it definitely makes people uncomfortable to watch with family and probably friends because no matter how hard you try, sex is very stigmatized and you can’t change it. 

something even worse than sex scenes in their uselessness is just nudity for the sake of nudity. that character didn’t need to be fully nude in that shot all their doing is lying in bed, or they are getting dressed so apparently i have to see them naked you couldn’t just stop at the bra. also, when a movie shows the entire stripper it’s unnecessary. i’ve seen a few movies that had scenes in strip clubs but avoided the nudity by just showing the legs and using the strip club exclusively as a backdrop.

Not only does he have zero respect for the input of any of his peers, he now sees himself as a academic superior to every form of authority in his life. He basically lords his accolades over the people in his class. He wouldn't know he has these traits if the staff at the school weren't instructed to constantly tell him this.

His ego is inflated so badly, that he has 0 friends. No one ""deserves"" to hang out with him, because hes ""too smart"" for everyone around him. He cant help but make fun of kids who struggle to read or do math because ""its just so easy why are you having a hard time."" He refuses to do homework because ""They might as well put me in 6th grade so what's it matter if I do homework or not.""

This shit sounds insanely familiar to me because the same fucking thing happened to me. I became isolated because I was actively searching for a challenge academically and I found it online, getting into ""intellectual debates"" with other ""logical people"" can you see where this is going. I was a late 90s early 00s neckbeard internet troll. This mentality became ingrained into my mind extremely early in my life when I was patted on the back and lorded over my peers as the ""smart kid"". Its toxic as hell to do this to kids and the particular personality traits people hate about adults comes from their childhood. 

GATE KIDS ARE CONDITIONED TO BELIEVE THEYRE ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE. This includes OTHER gate kids. This siphons the kids ability to be a fucking kid, have social lives, and make friends, by making everything a competition to be ""the smartest kid in _ grade""

I think Flat Earthers are trolls and do not actually believe the earth is flat.,"100% of Flat Earthers do not actually believe in a flat earth. If they do, it's just a strive for attention.

Instead of wasting your time on proving a flat earth is real, waste your time on proving it isn't real.

You may find more attention from the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

There is far FAR more evidence that the earth is round. Every planet we see is mostly, if not completely, round. The moon is round, the sun it round.

Also, how can you not believe in gravity? What do you call an object falling to the ground? What do you call the observation of black holes?

Do you Flat Earthers seriously think space streams from NASA are fake? That a live video stream is just CGI footage from space? How are the astronauts, foot, camera, tablets, etc. floating?

\- I am a NASA bot, you're all NASA bots and the world we perceive with our eyes is photoshoped. Maybe it's not the earth that is flat, but the perception of the earth.

\- A lot of people know a flat earther, but are not flat earthers themselves, further developing my unpopular opinion.

\- Some people are lonely and need friends. In order to make friends, they believe in an ideology in order to fit in with 'friend' and become more social, but the bubble of social is so small that you're not actually becoming more social, but secluding yourself so one single belief causing a brick wall effect on understanding and knowledge.

\- 'Actual' flat earthers do not strive for attention. They only want people to see and believe what they believe. They just do not have the evidence to prove themselves correct past what they have settled to believe.",unpopularopinion
"If it's okay to cast black actors to white characters, you should be okay with white actors playing black roles.","I saw a article on Twitter called ""Reimagining Batman as a black man""

I don't want Captain America to be recast as a Hispanic man, just because I'm Hispanic, I want more Hispanic superheroes if anything (yeah I'm aware Miles Morales has been getting the spotlight recently, I'm just giving an example)
The first instance I saw of this was people wanting to cast Michael B Jordan as Superman, and now Daniel Kaluuya as Batman, and honestly, Twitter would be blowing the fuck UP if they cast a white actor to play T'challa. Who remembers how angry people were when a white woman was cast to play the Ancient One, who in the comics is Asian (Chinese I think but I could be wrong)

I feel like I'm ranting so:
TL;DR
Don't expect white comic fans to be angry at casting POCs to play white characters, and DEFINITELY don't call them racist when they get mad at the inconsistency. 

EDIT: I know this is late but so many people have been saying that they agree with this and for these reasons, that's why they dont want a black James Bond.

The left needs to stop treating the right as their mortal enemies,"I know it doesn't mean much but I'm a lefty myself. And I've stated before that I hate what the left has become and is becoming. And one of the big things about that is this attitude that every person who holds conservative politics is immoral, fundamentally bad, and even evil.

The left has just been talking itself into an absolute frenzy lately and seem to think that say, if one or even multiple right wingers commit violent acts that everyone on the right wing either wishes they'd been the one doing it or condones the act. It should go without saying that this is untrue, just as if a group of communists were to bomb some place that rational reaction wouldn't be to blame the entire left wing movement. But yet they do. They also seem to forget that this isn't just your average low brow Republican, you know the one who sits at home watching fox news and votes straight R's down the board. These are people like nazis and 1488ers and other extreme groups among right wing thought.

But what aggravates me the most about this is the calls for calm. Not because it's something that shouldn't happen, but because it's so damn hypocritical. The left spends almost all it's time making the right wing out to be these mustache twirling super villains cackling to themselves while they plot the downfall of every woman, minority, and child in all of America and then they have the audacity to act like the problem is all from the other side. I'm not saying they are responsible for violence, but I am saying that if the left wants unity and calm, maybe the first place it should look at is in the mirror. It drives me batty what my party has become. I have no love in my heart for the right wing, but god  damn I don't think they are the most evil people to crawl from the earth, all with evil intentions and bad motives for any action they do. And I can guarantee you now that, because I'm saying this, I'm going to be accused of actually being a right winger.

The long and short of it is this: the right wing needs to settle down. Without question. But the left hasn't any high ground to cling to when they too are dolling out every insult they can latch on too. Unity requires us to work together, not for the right wing to just roll over and give the left anything and everything it wants, which is what many seem to think unity is. We work together, not as adversaries. Not that I honestly believe it will get through to many people in my party, but hell I'll at least give it a shot.",unpopularopinion
Fish are the most abused type of pet.,"Seriously, I can’t even list all the times I’ve seen stupid DIY projects with tiny enclosures for fish, or especially the amount of times I’ve seen shitty “tanks” with no filter, heater, etc. Not to mention how many photos I’ve seen of people blatantly abusing them because “they don’t have feelings” or “it’s just a fish.” People mostly treat them like little accessories or props instead of the live animals they are. Fish are much more intelligent than people think. Goldfish, for example, have a memory span of months, recognize their owners, ask for food, etc. They’ve even learned to do tricks such as play underwater soccer, react to different colors of lights and genres of music, and go through hoops. Like goldfish, bettas have also learned to do tricks like jumping through hoops above the water. Oscars like moving their decor until it’s to their liking and sometimes even ask to be petted. It’s also a total myth that fish grow to the size of their tanks, as only the outermost parts of their bodies stop growing when they’re in a tank too small. Their organs never stop, which leads to organ failure and premature death. It’s kind of similar to humans because they, too, can’t grow to their real size if they haven’t had much space to go, and that’s been proven. Why do you think the children found abandoned in basements and closets are always so tiny? People also keep their parameters sky-high and it’s ridiculous. Even a trace of ammonia can cause them stress and they can’t get away because they’re inside of it! Imagine being a kid and being stuck in an oil barrel for your whole life while always breathing in ammonia. It’s also so irritating that most people think fish are easy and cheap. Honestly, aquatic animals are the hardest animals I’ve taken care of. Fish are pets, too, and rely on you like any other pet. You’re all they have.

"There is absolutely nothing wrong with hiring a prostitute, and it should be legal everywhere.","I saw the confession today about a guy who was really depressed about hiring a sex worker, but there's nothing wrong with that, especially in a place where it's regulated. You're far safer having sex with a prostitute than you are having sex with some random girl at the bar. The prostitute is going to make sure the sex is always safe because this is how she makes her money.

A few years ago, I was lonely and decided to go to a legal brothel. I was incredibly nervous, but the girl I chose was incredibly sweet and patient with me, despite my anxiety. We talked about life, interests, a bunch of stuff. It wasn't just sex, it was companionship. After that day, things changed for me. I felt more confident. I started doing more things. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I could be intimate with people. This confidence really improved all parts of my life, and it's one of the reasons I'm doing so well in life right now. Today, she remains a close friend.

"Just because someone has it “worse” does not mean you can’t feel upset, overwhelmed, or depressed.","This really grinds my gears. I have a friend who was recently talking to me about being sexually assaulted. He was finally at a place where he could talk about it and admit what happened to him. At one point he stopped to say “I’m sorry I know what I went through isn’t even half as bad what you went through” I stopped him dead. I had to really think why he would feel the need to say such a thing. Then it hit me how bad society discredits our trials because “someone had it worse”.

Just because our lives are different does not discredit what you went through. Maybe you had more to eat as a child, or maybe I wasn’t abused as much as you. Possibly we are two separate minority’s and one of us is treated worse in society. Does not matter in the slightest. 

I do not live your life and you don’t live mine. I did not feel the abuse you went through.  This does not mean I wasn’t abused. This does not mean I had a better or worse life. It just simply means I had a different life.  Just because someone “was abused more than you” does not stop the blows.

You did not feel the hunger I went through. This does not mean I wasn’t poor growing up. Just because there are “starving kids in Africa” does not fill my belly with food.

It really hits me hard when someone is talking about their struggles. Then they get their own words shoved in their face.

"If we force anorexics to gain weight, we should force obese people to lose weight","People who have eating disorders are sometimes so starved and so underweight that they are committed to psychiatric wards, and forcibly given treatment. 

At the same time, obesity (now recognized as a disease) is not treated this way. People can eat and eat all they like and act morally outraged when someone tries to tell them to be healthier. 

Both are recognized as illness, yet only one has forcible intervention. It’s unnatural to be skinny in our society, but being obese is unnatural. I think it’s high time we force obese people to do what many refuse to do. I am by no means an example of good health, but at least I try to exercise and eat better. 

And let me address this whole “it’s my right to eat how I want and sit on my fat ass”. It’s your “right” until it impedes the rights of others. People who are obese are over-users of healthcare and are a (no pun intended) a heavy burden on hospitals and insurance companies. Your “choice” makes healthcare lower in quality and less affordable for others.

First of all I don’t mean any offense to women who are homemakers, but the housework itself is so easy. 

Laundry is not difficult, the only time consuming part is the folding. 

I can fly through piles of dishes (I’ve worked as a dishwasher before) without even glancing at the dishwasher. 

Sweeping, vacuuming and mopping are quick and easy tasks. 

Outdoor work which is traditionally a man’s work has been engrained into me from cleaning gutters, raking leaves, mowing lawns and shoveling snow. That is all work that could be done during the day if I wasn’t at a job. 

Besides providing breast milk, I believe I could care for a baby with the upmost care, and teach a child to a  level that would put them head and shoulders above their peers when entering school, academically and morally. 

So ladies, go ahead and take over the work force please. You’ll be the suckers once you’re off making the bread and I’m at home blasting music, talking to my buddies on the phone while prancing around in my skivvies getting all my work done.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone for your responses. The women who agree that the work is easy, the men who say it’s hard or endless, the men who’d love to do it, and the women who say how hard it is. 

First of all let me say I’d never be able to justify staying home if there weren’t children to take care of. 

To all of you telling me that since I don’t have kids I’m a fool and that I’d be totally overwhelmed by the responsibilities of raising a child; I would put more effort and energy into raising a child than I would into any other job I can possibly think of. If I had all day every day to teach my child new skills and ideas, play new games with them, teach them lessons and answer their questions, I would wipe 100 poopy butts a day, sleep 1 hour a night and give every ounce of who I am so that they can reach their highest potential. 

I never said having a kid wouldn’t be hard. I’m saying I know what I’d be willing to put into it and everything I just stated would bring me infinitely more fulfillment than any other job possibly could. 

That child is the most important thing in your life, maybe instead of whining about how annoying they get or how tired they make you, treat them like what they really should be; the most important job you’ll ever have in your entire life.",unpopularopinion

Alcohol is stupid and the overglorification of it is annoying.,"(Yes, I realize this is not that unpopular of an opinion on reddit. It still is an unpopular opinion towards the majority of the population)

First off, the whole ""lol you aren't mature if you don't drink alcohol"" is a complete joke. Maturity isn't defined by the act of poisoning your body, no matter the cause. Somehow it's been decided that drinking is tied to adulthood, no matter what. 

People get way too defensive about it. I remember a study being posted here on reddit a bit ago that went like ""No amount of alcohol is good for you"" and half the comments where ""lol i'm still gonna drink it"". The study didn't tell you to stop, no one did. You just assumed that any negative comment about a poison is a direct attack on your habits. It's a scientific study. 

Hell, you can't even deny a drink at a party or anyplace else without being thought of as someone who thinks better of themselves. You have to make up an excuse, or else you're seen as a stuck up prude. Can you imagine that with any other thing? ""Oh, you don't like sandwiches? Why? Yknow acting all high and mighty by not liking sandwiches is not cool"". Like it's ridiculous.

""But it's been a part of human culture for centuries!"". Yeah, so has opression of minorities and women, slavery, genocide, etc... 
*Edit* It has come to my attention that this was a very badly worded argument. I didn't mean to put them in the same category, it was more a jab at how the ""we've done it for a long time!"" isn't a very strong argument. I apologize for the confusion.

The normalization of blatant alcoholism isn't a good thing. I'm almost 100% sure that if alcohol never existed and it was barely introduced these last few years, the FDA would have shut that thing down faster than most other drugs. I'm specifically talking about booze here, not alcohol in general (since I know pure alcohol has medical uses, but not beer/wine/booze).

Note, this isn't a ""Lol let's hate EVERYONE who drinks"". If you like to drink a ton, you do you. If you only enjoy a drink every now and then, more power to ya. This is a post against beer culture, not an attack towards you or your preferred drink.",unpopularopinion

It’s their life, they call the shots. If someone wants to end their life, it’s their decision. 

A lot of people who say this have probably never been to the brink of suicide themselves. Don’t attack me in the comments saying “oh, I was going to kill myself but I think it’s selfish”. Ok, good to know, but I feel like a lot of people who say that have never seriously considered taking their own life.

People who start off writing fan fiction shouldn’t be mocked,"We all have to start off somewhere. I started off writing fan fiction. It sharpened my writing skills and kept me in practice until I thought of a plot line and story that I was passionate about writing, then I moved upward. I think it’s so often brushed off as ‘not real writing’ (by people who have likely never touched pen to paper for anything longer than an essay, no less) but it is still a valid form of art and expression that has its own benefits. 

We don’t condescend and mock artists who start off painting on paper instead of canvases, or biologists who buy science kits and go out into their backyard, so why mock kids who start off writing fan fiction? They’re still working up to their dreams, whether you deem it an embarrassing hobby or not. It doesn’t matter if you’re writing fan fiction or short stories, the writer *still* has to think of plots behind them, of intricate details and subtle messages. It’s insulting to assume otherwise when these kids are putting a lot of effort into their art. They should be celebrated for finding something they’re passionate about, not mocked because it doesn’t live up to societal standards of what a good story is.

I can’t tell you how many times I had people messaging me when I wrote fan fiction on Wattpad, asking or even telling me to write a plot or story about this or that. Thinking of a good plot *isn’t the hard part*. It’s sticking with one story and not losing the passion to continue writing it. Fan fiction is a good place to start, for many kids, as a lot of their first passions can be an artist they love or a show they watch. 

So if kids show an interest in writing fan fiction, they should be encouraged, not mocked. I hid my hobby for five years, even while my stories reached millions of readers, because it just wasn’t seen as a valid form of expression and art. But it’s just as valid as the scientist who starts out working at home or going to science camps.",unpopularopinion

Nothing against the animals themselves - I find dogs cute, I just could never see myself bringing one into my house and caring for it as if it's a person.That's another key point about animal people - your animal is not a human being.

You see a lot of white people claiming to be “Irish, Swedish, Scottish etc” when in reality they’re generations removed from the closest relative from those countries and many have never even been to those countries/have any idea of the actual culture.

However, anytime my wife takes off work, she always gets comments like “must be nice” or “well, you don’t have kids so that’s why you have money to vacation.”  No.  That’s not why.

Waffles are superior to pancakes in every way.,"Frankly, I don’t know if this unpopular or not, but waffles are so much freaking better than pancakes and it’s not even close. Pancakes are flat little bastards who can’t even hold syrup. Waffles have built in pockets to hold the good uh uh. And have you heard of toaster pancakes? No, because they don’t want to be convenient for you. Waffles know you’re busy, and they’re like hey bud, eat me after a minute in the toaster I got you.

And does anyone really enjoy going to ihop? I don’t, it’s overpriced and my experience is never consistent. Waffle House on the other hand is cheap, 24 hours, and no matter if I’m in the rich suburbs, the ghetto, or in a beach town, it has the same consistency everywhere. Honestly I can only think of one place where pancakes are good, and that’s McDonald’s. And they’re not even called pancakes, they’re called hot cakes, cause they don’t wanna be associated with trash pancakes.

And my final point, other forms of waffles are dope, waffle cones are first to come to mind. They don’t have pancake cones because pancakes are floppy and sloppy just like your ex. Waffles even inspired one of the other good foods of America, French fries, into evolving into a superior potato food- waffle fries.

Oh and I know I said that was my final point, but I thought of one more. I can’t think of an insult involving waffles except for the corny dad joke of Waffle House being called “awful waffle,” but no one ever means it. But if you want to be a misogynistic douche bag to a girl you can call her a pancake. Bruh, not cool. If someone called me a waffle, I’d be dope with that, and wonder what are they smoking, but if someone calls someone a pancake or a pancake ass or chest, it’s not cool. Waffles will never hurt you.

TLDR: pancakes are 🚮 and waffles are the greatest breakfast food of all time (except for bacon of course)

Edit 1: okay so the waffle gang is fighting the pancake posse. However, I will say this so people understand my reasonings. Waffle House waffles are A tier, whereas your eggo brand waffles are a solid C+. Both of these are perfectly fine and still light years ahead of that filthy pancake lust I see in the comments.

The problem is that our world focuses more on these cringy, outcasted, toxic idiots rather than people like scientists, engineers, and health experts who want to fix the earth and make it a much better place for future generations.

Turn on the news or any social media and you'll always hear about who gave birth to whose kid, who got arrested, who raped who, etc. It's ok once in a while but after a while it becomes annoying, repetitive, and boring. Instead, I feel that as a society we'd do a lot better without praising and celebrating these moronic celebrities and start worrying about what's really ruining humanity through people who actually care about it.",unpopularopinion

The Media shouldn't be allowed to report on rape cases without a guilty verdict.,"As someone who has seen what the accusation of rape or sexual assault does to someone who is innocent, it is life destroying. People lose their jobs, their scholarships, friends, their future prospects, all because of one person's word. With no proof.

The media reporting on rape/sexual assault cases before a guilty verdict steamrolls those that are innocent and links their name to an event that will forever be searchable online, no matter where that individual goes.

In law, we have ""guilty beyond a reasonably doubt"". But anyone that is accused of any kind of abuse or sexual misconduct is treated like they are guilty, even when proven innocent, many still try to say ""oh he just got away with it."".

In my opinion, until a guilty verdict is announced, media should not be allowed to smear a potentially good man/woman's name through the mud, forever destroying their future prospects and potentially adding to the psychological trauma the VICTIM has suffered as a result of the false accusation.

So to recap: Someone's accused of rape/sexual assault? No media involvement.Goes to court: No media involvement.Is found innocent!: No media involvement.Is found guilty: Media involvement.

&amp;#x200B;

This goes beyond protecting victims of being falsely accused, but also provides protection for those that are legitimate victims and accuse someone. No media attention at all when you gather the courage to step forward and tell your story and try to get justice. And if you can't prove it (which is how, statistically, most rape cases go), your name isn't forever attached to it either.

This would be better for both victim and accused.

We shouldn't give puberty blockers to 10-year-olds. The clinics currently doing this should be shut down and all 'professionals' involved should be sued/arrested.,"GnRH agonists used to block puberty include leuprorelin (Lupron) and triptorelin (Trelstar). There are multiple studies pointing to GnRHas lowering IQ and negatively impacting brain function in general.

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00044/full#B6

&gt;Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHas) have been found to impair memory in adults, so the study by Wojniusz et al. (2016) on the possible cognitive effects of these drugs on children treated for idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) represents an important contribution to research in this area . . . Recent findings that GnRHas increase depression symptoms (Macoveanu et al., 2016) and slow reaction time (Stenbæk et al., 2016) in healthy women, and reduce long-term spatial memory in sheep (Hough et al., 2017) underline the importance of the research that Wojniusz et al. (2016) have undertaken. Girls treated for CPP with triptorelin acetate were tested with the short form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III. 

&gt;**It was found that the girls had a mean IQ of 94, as against a mean IQ of 102 for the matched control group (Wojniusz et al., 2016).** These IQ estimations are presented as standardized IQ scores, which places a girl scoring 102 at the 55th percentile, and a girl scoring of 94 at the 34th percentile. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=27462292

+

&gt;The findings of Wojniusz et al. (2016) can be compared with those of a 2001 study in which 25 children treated for early puberty with triptorelin acetate were tested with the short form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Mul et al., 2001). In this longitudinal study, children took the IQ test before treatment and again after 2 years of treatment. **It was found that their IQ dropped 7 points from 100 to 93.** With 25 treated participants, this 7 point drop was significant (p = 0.002).  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=11683207

&gt;Single person study of effects of puberty blockers on 12-year-old shows **IQ drop of 9 points in 15 months**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694455/ 

But wait, there's more...



&gt;Staphorsius et al. (2015) conducted a study in a GD adolescent group under hormonal suppression to investigate the impact of pubertal suppression on executive function (EF). They compared GD adolescents under GnRHa treatment to GD adolescents undergoing physiological puberty and compared them to male and female control groups. They used the Tower of London test and found a negative impact of pubertal suppression on EF. However, they also associate this outcome with a lower IQ before GnRHa treatment.

&gt;Additionally, a global IQ decrease (WISC-III) was reported in a longitudinal follow-up of girls with central precocious puberty (Schuerger and Witt, 1989) treated with GnRHa. 

&gt;Finally, a third study correlated verbal skill impairment to pubertal suppression in a GD group (Costa et al., 2015).

_

To make matters worse, there are several studies that show natural desistance when 'GD'-diagnosed kids are simply left 'untreated', aka out of the claws of these predatory clinics. [This page compiled many of them.](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html)

Oh, and re: the lie that they're reversible:


&gt;Yet a Freedom of Information request to the NHS Health Research Authority showed the study’s own research protocol stated:

&gt;""It is not clear what the long-term effects of early suppression may be on bone development, height, sex organ development and body shape and their reversibility if treatment is stopped during pubertal development”.

&gt;In an interview with the Guardian in 2015, Dr Carmichael admitted:

I am pretty sure if I saw someone getting around in a chefs outfit I would assume they were a chef.... I wouldn't waste my time going...""well sure... that's how they look... but maybe they are *really* an astronaut"".

Pfft.

Edit:

There's been some interesting and valid points raised on both sides of this issue.

Some of you are right, I could have wrote this better.... I had no idea it would be this huge.

I apologise if my opinion offended anyone. I do understand that this *is* a big deal for some... I don't think its something I'll ever wrap my head around entirely though...

It is not the issue of non binary itself so much... it may be unbelievable to some but there are the 'you assumed my gender' types out there... but I concede for some they are few and far between... I just happen to have someone in my inner circle who amplifies this issue... daily... and it is tedious.... just as it would be tedious if I pushed my 'stuff' every single day eg lesbianism or my career or my views on parenting or climate change etc etc

In hindsight I should have posted in 'confessions' and simply stated that my non binary friend is driving me nuts...

Gay Pride Parades Are Trashy,"Sexual orientation doesn't always mean who you fuck in the bedroom. It also means who you have relationships with, who you bond with and love unconditionally. They should wear nice clothes at these parades, they should strive to look sharp and beautiful. If there were straight pride parades I would dress up as nicely as I possibly could, my very best clothes. You want to show the world that it isn't just about putting your dick inside somebody's asshole. It's much more than just that, it's about being able to love someone and not be executed for it. Just like how it isn't always about putting your dick in a vagina when it comes to straight people.

I always see gay pride parades full of people wearing BDSM gear or stripped to just about bare ass naked with a giant pink dildo strapped to their foreheads and dry humping each other. Those are fetishes, those have nothing to do with sexual orientation. They should enforce a dress code to ensure they dress nicely and sharp so they can represent the LGBT community under a positive light. 

There's nothing wrong with holding hands or kissing. Just don't dress up like you're about to commence a giant orgy. It does exactly the opposite of what they want to happen which is acceptance from the world and makes people see them as outliers.",unpopularopinion

Dark humour is a good thing for society and makes the world a more tolerant place.,"EDIT: Holy shit thanks for the silver!

EDIT: Thanks for the gold as well!

I know the title of this post is a bit vague, but the TL;DR is pretty much “rainbow-pilled ideology used to be the societal default, let’s go back to it”.

I’ll start this with another unpopular opinion: thinking something is funny is the first step to thinking that something is valid. If you despise something or someone and then start making jokes about them, you acknowledge their existence as a human for the first time. If you hate trans people because you’re ignorant about trans culture or don’t understand it, a ladyboy joke in the pub might well be your first exposure to concepts like gender dysphoria and trans identity. One theory on the origin of dead baby jokes states that they were a product of a second-wave feminist effort to dehumanise the fetus and make people more in favour of female body ownership. People laughed at the concept of killing babies, which led to people being favourable towards abortion, which is now considered to be a basic human right in many nations and ideologies.

The same could be said for any civil rights movement. There was a period in the 2000’s and early 2010’s where tolerance seemed to just be a given. Even though it took time for people of different colours, with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community to be treated as equals on paper in the eyes of the law, the burning racism and homophobia that seems somewhat normal today was confined to the very extreme right. That’s because that time was also a golden age for dark humour, society’s own context in which expressing reactionary belief was acceptable and at the same time considered non-canon and non-serious.

Online hate forums were definitely a thing back then, but they didn’t have a monopoly on sick jokes. /pol/, for example, was the same mix of actual Nazis and ironic Nazis it is today, but websites like Sickipedia and Facebook pages like Seriously Sick Jokes and Butthurt helped open the gap between people who were joking and people who were actually terrible humans. The justification was that dark humour was making fun of racists and not races, homophobes and not homosexuals, and so on and civilisation just sort of became used to the idea that having a hatred for Muslims living in your head rent-free was something to be mocked. 

Then PC culture, which had been around for a while, took off around 2014-15. After Sickipedia closed down its servers and Facebook purged the joke pages for being offensive, things got far worse. Racism grew, homophobia grew and transphobia grew, because there was no acceptable way to mock or make light of the rapid cultural advancement that had also begun to happen without being linked with people who hated this cultural advancement. The humour that used to help intolerant people cope with and accept progressive change was now indistinguishable from verbal harm. People are now more extreme at either side of the political spectrum because satire and sarcasm are dead concepts. If you make a joke and somebody says it’s racist, you’re racist, no ifs, no buts. It’s been a scary thing to watch over the last few years.

In 2019 “hate speech” has no other context: all racist language comes from a place of racial hatred, etc. People look for racial context in all jokes and “cancel” the joke teller for even being tenuous. There are even cases of people making jokes when it was more acceptable being fired years later. The flip side of this is that people who *are* joking are now encouraging and abating racism because the is no such as a “racist joke”- there is only non-ironic racism. This isn’t a progressive society, this is moving backwards and living in fear of not only what we say, but what we used to say.

If the world gained a new mainstream forum to post dark jokes (or even their own terrible opinions worded in the form of humour), it wouldn’t be perfect, but it would be a significantly less violent and sectarian place.",unpopularopinion

Small breasts are way sexier than giant ones,"I have never understood the typical male obsession with giant breasts.

Giant breasts are unwieldy and usually rife with varicose veins.

They are not pleasant to look at or to fondle in contrast to small, perky breasts.

Often a giant set of breasts flops out and are tremendously saggy. Also quite often the nipples are the circumference of burger patties which also looks unpleasant.

Also if the woman is on top during sex, I can tell you from experience that a giant set of breasts will flop and bounce around like crazy, to such an extent that it is offputting as they bounce so perilously close to the face that I risk having an eye poked out by a nipple. This limits my enjoyment of my favourite sexual position.

EDIT: Everyone, I wasn't really taking aim at big-breasted women; I should have prefaced by saying that all of the big breasts I have seen are unappealing -- either because they are very veiny (and yes, I have seen this in small breasts as well) or the nipples giant, to the point where the nipple covers almost the entire visible breast so it looks like a piglet spinning a medal on its snout.

Perhaps I just never encountered an excellent set of large breasts with sexy nipples and perkiness akin to the delicately sculpted wine glass titties I've so enjoyed encountering over the years.

If you like to eat your shit a certain way then that's fine, but the level of pretentiousness surrounding how steaks should be cooked is reaching wine tasting levels of self-fellating fart sniffing horseshit and its getting pretty tiresome.

I like a steak medium. I do not need to go into a restaurant where I get looked down on because I don't want it medium rare or rarer. If as a restaurant owner you don't like cooking medium/well steaks, *then don't ask people how they like their food*. It may shock you to realise that people have preferences that may not match up to your own.

If you've been paying attention to social media lately then you are aware of the sick and vile confession that she made in Instagram lately.

She admitted in cold blood that she used to drug and steal money from men after decieving them into thinking she was going to have sex with them. 

And on top of that she had the nerve to try to make the general public feel sorry for her as if she didn't have a choice when she clearly wanted to do it.

If any male was in the same situation, they would be arrested almost instantly without question. But because she famous, and Latina, and had a hard life, people are just glossing over it like this is normal.

But there are more things to despise about this rotten excuse of a woman.

She acts like she was forced into stripping and hoeing around. Meanwhile, Nicki Minaj worked at fast food joints and sold mixtapes on the corner so there is no excuse for her career choice.

She regularly makes racist and homophobic slurs and pretends like they never happened.

She has no talent, no respect for music, and clearly will do anything just to stay relevant, like a classless Kardashian, so to speak.

Everything about her is fake and shallow. Her music, her ""tributes to other latinas"" , her ""eccentric"" personality which is really just her acting like ghetto trash.

She is the literal epitome of every single negative stereotype people have had about ghetto latinas but she is so much worse.

She is literally nothing but a fame loving, sex addicted, illiterate, money obsessed, semi retarded, self absorbed, piece of shit attention whore who just got lucky.

Defend her if you want but I have honestly rarely despised any celebrity as much as her. And the worst part is, her fans don't even care because for some insane reason the believe she is God's gift to earth no matter how much of a fuck up she actually is.

Above all else however, she is nothing more than a pathetic criminal who wants sympathy for her actions and derserves to go to prison for her actions.

"GMO Crops are perfectly safe and healthy, and are good for the earth.","Almost all of our food today, in terms of grain crops, has been modified and cultured in some way. Of course, it’s not like they used CRISPR on corn two hundred years ago, but there is more than one way to modify food. With those modifications, though, come some serious controversies. People believe that these genetically modified crops can have a massively negative impact on our environment, which is often enforce by the mainstream media. I don’t mean to scream fake news, as there is some real research there, but it doesn’t tend to look at the entire picture. In an in-depth study conducted over 13 years involving more than 5,000 maize and 5,000 soy farms, researchers found that initial results of crops that produced their own herbicide and insecticide was positive, though over time weeds began to develop a resistance to the natural herbicide, causing many farmers to resort to buying their herbicide from manufacturers. However, this study was conducted not only on the impact on the *farmers*, not the farm, but also by an economist, not a biologist, geneticist, or even an anthropologist. It also focuses on one of the more recent modifications, one that only became prevalent in the USA after 1995, when the Environmental Protection Agency made it legal. Crops have been bred and modified for thousands of years, with one of the earliest examples being that of corn, which would have originally looked something closer to teosinte, or *Zea Luxurians*, a type of wild grass from Central and South America, eaten some 7,000–3,000 years ago (Grobman 1). Much of the corn we have today looks nothing like *Luxurians*, being almost a completely different species, *Zea Mays*. It grows well, and due to its natural domestication and modification through selective breeding, has a much lower impact on its environment than its “GMO” counterparts. These crops are plentiful, clean, and healthy for both us as humans and the environment they’re grown in. That being said, there are some advantages that those GMO crops have over naturally bred produce. Many farmers have begun to recognize the ease with which GMO crops can grow, even if consumers don’t recognize the benefits. That’s why, from 1995 to 2004, less than ten years, the amount of GMO produce grown increased from 0 to approximately 90,000,000 hectares world wide. That number has only grown, despite popular opinion that GMOs are “poisonous” and “toxic”. There is a god chance you’ve eaten some form of modified or specially bred crop, whether store-bought, in a restaurant, or out of a vending machine.

Many people consider GMO crops to be poisonous or toxic. According to an article in *Scientific American*, “Many people believe that GMOs are bad for their health – even poisonous – and that they damage the environment. This is in spite of overwhelming scientific evidence that proves that GMOs are safe to eat, and that they bring environmental benefits. . .” (Blancke, 1). These people refuse to eat GMO crops, depending on their own feelings and assumptions about genetics, i.e. adding fish genes to tomatoes will make them taste “fishy” (they don’t). These people refuse to accept scientific evidence of helpful GMO crops, similar to someone denying the positive medical effects of vaccines. There is a plethora of scientific evidence for GMOs, from positive environmental effects to economic advantages for farmers.

GMO crops have, other than in select cases, a very positive influence on the environment, specifically in terms of conservation of habitats. GMOs have, in general, a much larger crop yield, meaning that they are more sustainable, and can feed more people with less land (Thompson 71). This means that natural ecosystems that otherwise would have been razed to make room for more farmland can now flourish in the way they would have had they never been adulterated by human development. That being said, many poorer subsistence farmers cannot afford these space saving GMOs, nor do they desire them, determined to remain dead-set in the agricultural practice known as “slash and burn” agriculture. This is when a farmer (or land company) cuts down and burns a section of rainforest to clear out space, farms it intensely until the soil is exhausted of nutrients, then moves on to a new piece of land. If these people would adopt the new GM crops, as well as modernized forms of rotational agriculture, land would be much more sustainable and even profitable after a time.

Another form of GMO crops are crops that produce their own insecticide. Don’t confuse that with herbicide, another form of GMO with negative influence on a farm. Insecticide crops produce, essentially, natural pesticides. This is by use of a gene that is active against insects taken from the bacteria *Bacillus thuringiensis*, or Bt. These come in two primary forms, known commonly as “Bt Cotton” and “Bt maize”. Each are grown separately, and with their own drawbacks and advantages.

Bt Cotton:

Bt cotton is widely accepted and not heavily contested, as it is not consumed as food, so we won’t spend much time on it. It is grown all around the world, with the primary advantage, of course, being a lack of pesticide use. Cotton farmers used more pesticide than any other farmers previous to the introduction of Bt cotton (Thompson 13), as there is essentially no demand for “organic” cotton, so no one particularly cared. Of course, people only really care about things that affect them, so it’s understandable that no one would bat an eye about millions of square miles of land and ecosystem being systematically poisoned by thousands of farmers for decades. If no one cared, you might ask, why make Bt cotton a thing? The answer, my friend, is in the economics. A farmer has to pay for his insecticide, and if around four million pounds of it is dumped on cotton a year, that’s a lot of money going to insecticide companies, which means a lot of money leaving the hands of farmers, for instance $500 million USD a year for China alone (Thompson 14). Cotton typically requires between five to twelve sprays with insecticide yearly, depending on the region it’s grown in. When Bt cotton was introduced, people began to only need to spray cotton three to four times a year, at most nine, at least one, which cut pesticide use by around 50% (bear in mind that 20% of US farmers still grow natural cotton) (Thompson 13). Which is fantastic, just another two million pounds to go.

Bt Maize:

Bt maize is a much more touchy subject for most people. It's used in everything: breads, pastries, soft drinks, and of course, corn. Corn itself is not natural, obviously, so what makes Bt corn worse? Believe it or not, nothing. The first type of Bt corn was designed to keep insects away, and, as a side effect, make farmers spend less on pesticides (Thompson 22). That being said, the economic factor is not as large as it is with cotton. According to the EPA, “\[their\] analysis of Bt crops finds that they pose no significant risk to the environment or to human health.”  

Although there are some cons to using specific forms of experimental GMO crops, i.e. crops that produce their own herbicide, the pros of almost all GMO crops far outweigh any minimal cons. There is a slight possibility that their impact will only be felt in long term effects, but we can never really be sure. The simplicity of moving agriculture from medieval England the the twenty first century is to adopt GMO crops as a source of food. With a population of 7.4 billion and growing, the only way for humans to survive and still conserve the natural world is to adopt higher yield GMO crops internationally. Much of the stigma around GMOs is similar to the popular fear of gluten, a harmless chemical found in grain that for some reason twenty and thirty somethings are deathly afraid of. GMOs are harmless, and can only improve and grow with new technology.

But how often do you hear about how romcoms and sitcoms where the men are total whipped wimps are damaging to relationships?

White people have inherent racism hard wired into them, black people too, asian......all of us have racial prejudices but it is completely harmless as long as you are aware of it, embrace it and use it for good.",unpopularopinion
"If women had to pay more for car insurance than men, there would be outrage","Think about it, men literally have to pay more for insurance just because statistically men get into more severe accidents. Because you are a man, its assumed theres a higher chance you'll cause an accident. How is that not blatantly sexist? You could be a man who will be a perfect driver or a woman who's gonna be a reckless driver, but just because of the sex alone, the man has to pay more when the record starts.

I know for a fact that if the opposite happened it would NEVER stand. ""You have to pay more because you're a woman and women get into more severe accidents"" just listen to that, do you think that shit would ever be allowed?",unpopularopinion

Now we broken all the barriers about race, sex or homosexuality but they can’t let it go. After we had a black president for two terms you’d think they’d appreciate the direction the country went but no, they claim racism is worse than it was in the 1800s.

Being religious does not make you a good person.,"I find that a lot of religious people are assholes. You're not allowed to disagree with them on anything because they know better than everyone else. They don't bother to solve their own problems because god will. They also base their opinions on an old book rather than morals and logic. It's okay for them to question your lack of beliefs but not okay for you to question their religion.

&amp;#x200B;

This probably isn't how every religious person is, but my mom acts this way and I hate it. I'll be like, ""This is some pretty good pizza"" and she'll say, ""That's not what the bible says."" Okay, maybe not, but you get the point.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I'll ask her questions about Christianity out of curiosity and she'll get mad at me for for questioning her beliefs. Of course I'm gonna question these beliefs. I'm not gonna be an atheist without fully understanding what I'm claiming isn't true. She doesn't understand the idea of a civil discussion. I'm not trying to change her beliefs, I'm trying to change mine. I almost want to believe god. It seems like it would make me much happier. These discussions always end with her saying, ""Not everything has an explanation."" That's gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Why would something not have an explanation?

&amp;#x200B;

She also told me one time that terrorists and atheists are the same thing. I don't know if she actually thought that or if she really wanted me to be Christian.

&amp;#x200B;

Since you're reading this far, I'm gonna assume that you've already gotten about as offended as you're gonna get, so I'm just gonna say it. Religion is absolutely ridiculous. ""OP, isn't it hypocritical for you to make a statement like that after complaining about religious people doing the same thing?"" Well, I feel like there's a lot more evidence going towards atheism than religion. We've explained just about everything that religion was created to explain. If god created the universe, who created him? Well, you're not supposed to question it. Just keep giving your money to that church. See my point? Sorry if you're religious and I just gave you a mental breakdown. I urge you to think for yourself and consider the other side. Your future self will thank you.

Sexual Harassment Is Normalized On Males,"Yeah, you read right. I believe sexual harassment against men has been normalized through millions and millions of years of the notion of men being 100% sexually acceptive all the time being just stamped next to their name, like a fuckin' badge on their driver's license. 

Women play grab-ass and guys are just to laugh it off or even are encouraged to feel flattered because ""chicks dig you bro!"" When in reality that's fuckin' pathetic you stank bitch, keep your hands off of that poor man. 

Prime-Fuckin'-Example: Carbi-Motherfuckin'-B. Men were D R U G G E D and R O B B E D. But bitches be all like ""yaasssss queen she sent her man pussy pics only six weeks after givin' birth!""(Granted, this is not sexual harassment but it's a good ass example of crimes against men by women being easily dismissed.)

Furthermore, Shia LeBeouf: raped and tortured. Terry Crews: sexually assaulted. Johnny Depp: abused in every way. 

Zero movements to help these poor men despite the incriminating evidence. 

On god. It is atrocious the injustice of these men told to just accept this shit. NO. DO NOT ACCEPT IT. 

If you are uncomfortable, feeling targeted, attacked, harassed, abused, anything--Men, do something. Speak up. Cuss the bitch out. Blow that mother fuckin' whistle and call her the fuck out for being a gotdamn lowlife pervert. 

You don't want this bitch touching your arm? Don't let the bitch touch your arm! Tell her to keep her ugg-mugg lookin' ass in her mother fuckin' corner.

And don't any of you come at me with that ""Men can handle it. They're supposed to me tough"" horseshit. That is some straight-up, stomped through the mud, horseS H I T.

Don't come at me with that superficial, uneducated, no-source, assuming, double-standard, shallow, dumbassery, bitch. That's like saying, when a woman get's raped, ""She's fine. Women's bodies are made to receive dick.""

Edit: ""This isn't unpopular"" No it's pretty fuckin unpopular mate because nothing's being done. Little boys are still being touched and molested and sent nasty-ass texts by their female teachers, or even raped. This is pretty fuckin' unpopular cos you got some adult males who are defending female predators like ""women can't hurt men"". 

""I'm seeing this everywhere so it's not unpopular"" Well you're gonna see it again, and again, and again. This is not some hot topic mother fuckers. This is an actual issue, a real life problem needing addressed with seriousness and fucking solved for the sake of these little boys so they can grow up feeling support to know that their feelings of unwanting sexual advances are correct, and for these men who were harassed and assaulted and abused to know that what happened to them was in no way alright. 

I reiterate, just because she is a female, because she is physically weaker than you, does not make her innocent. She is just as much of a piece of shit as the molesters in prison. 

And OF COURSE this extends to all realms of harassment and abuse towards men, I just shone some light on crimes committed by women because, as I said, men are afraid to call they asses the fuck out.

2. Women are so emotionally vulnerable that the rules of public discourse must change drastically in order to accommodate them.

Russia meddling in the election should not be a thing.  Americans should be able to wade through ideas own their own.

Our government is annoyed that someone else is messing with their sheep.  What did Russia actually do?  Put forth political ideas?

How is that even worth noting?  It is important because our failings in education are easily manipulated.  It's just that Americans are the ones that are supposed to manipulate Americans.

You cannot blame Russia for our populous' inability to think for themselves.  I can blame a education system funded by a lottery paid by people who failed to get enough of an education to understand odds.

Video games are just as credible as any other art form and the public needs to start treating it as such.,"Video games are art. Yea, I said it. Video games have consistently showed me that it values artistic expression. From allegories like Shadow of the Colossus to long epics like Final Fantasy, they have consistently used imagery, storytelling, and user interaction to help engage the user with some kind of emotional expression. Hold your horses on the “How is Call of Duty art?” narrative. All art serves a different purpose. For instance, John Wick provides a different experience than say something like Whiplash. Same goes for Dr. Seuss compared to Maya Angelou. Or your 4 year old nephew’s refrigerator drawing and Van Gogh.

A college graduation, in which you are wearing professional robes, walking across a stage among doctors and experts in their field is not the place to act like a child. It is a place to act dignified. Post graduation celebrations you have license do whatever you want, but when you and a small group of people add an hour to a ceremony, you are being an ass and causing irritation among many people. Graduation is, believe it or not, not about you as an individual and not everyone is there to see you. 

Ultimately, just because you are black does not mean the ceremony should revolve around you. Quit attempting backflips. Quit dancing for 5 minutes straight. Quit faking out professors who are shaking your hand on stage. Quit ignoring any white professor on the stage and walking past to give the black professor a hug (yes I've watched this happen).

"Race, ethnicity, religion etc. should not be considered in college admissions.","My thought process on this is simple; the people that are most qualified, have the best LORs, write the best essays, have the best grades should be admitted to the best schools. The color of your skin should have no impact on whether or not you’re admitted to a college. 

What bothers me the most about the way admissions decisions are being made is that more qualified people are being denied admission because colleges are concerned with admitting certain percentages of people that are considered minorities or underprivileged. 

The recent lawsuit against Harvard is a perfect example. Asian applicants had to score higher on standardized tests to gain admission because the university wants “diversity”. What’s being called diversity is really racism, because certain groups are held to different standards based on race.  

Why not just admit the most qualified people? If you end up with a student body that is predominantly Asian, or any other race, so be it; they earned it.

The counter argument is usually that diversity is beneficial and promotes innovation. I have no reason to dispute that, I’m sure it does. There would still be plenty of diversity at most colleges if race wasn’t considered. I’m simply not convinced that diversity warrants holding different races to different standards, especially for the most competitive universities. 

Despite holding this opinion, I don’t support trying to force private universities to change their admissions policies. I think that the autonomy afforded by being a private university shouldn’t be encroached unless there was egregious racism, sexism, etc.

Others and I quickly called him out on his hypocrisy. He was receptive and we moved on, but he told us this is a common mindset.  

Just because someone’s ancestors were racist, doesn’t give you the right to start putting down the descendants from those pricks, because then you become the asshole.  Children are boys, adults are men, for the education of all races out there including my own(even though I’m a Cherokee, often accused of being white European, I was here before all you bitches😜).

I’ve been denied jobs and promotions just like any of you claim to have, but your families haven’t left you alone without telling you that they are going out to dinner, or stopped loving you. Homosexuals know oppression very well.  I don’t even contact my parents anymore because they are racist/homophobic so I know oppression deeper than most, since it comes from even my own family.  Not many other races can claim this type of exclusion from their own parents.  There were times I wished myself dead, but now I’m living a way better life than my racist parents did.  Let’s agree to not insert meaning where it’s not here.

We are talking about the present, not the world your grandparents dwelled on and I never said this is any worse. Doesn’t mean it’s okay to act like a piece of shit to whites today.

Last edit:  Seems a lot of you have a guilty conscience with this.

Black rappers overplay the black victim/slave mentality unfairly. They are rich and famous. Not victims of slavery.,"I’m so tired of seeing rappers like Kendrick Lamar or J Cole consistently talk about how black people as a collective force are being oppressed. By listening to their lyrics, you would start thinking as if we’re still living in the ages of slavery where they’re locked up in chains by their white masters.

The truth, of course, could not be more different. Black people are currently overrepresented in all forms of music and media. Just being a non black rapper in music ruins your reputation. When was the last time you saw the New York Times preaching diversity in an industry dominated by black people? Never. Now take movies for example. Black men are regularly cast as the main stars for movies despite only being 13% of the population compared to Hispanics that constitute a greater percentage. When was the last time you saw popular movies with the main actors being Hispanic? Or Indian? Or Asian? 

It’s upsetting to see clearly rich, famous, successful people continually overplay the black victim mentality within their lyrics, and even at concerts.

Even that word is an insult to the people, it suggest that companies view the general public as sheep who can be controlled and herded with well placed ‘influencers’ who push trends and ideas. It’s not just about shopping on a certain website your favourite YouTuber uses, they use people who are considered “cool” to push social trends, and the worst part is, we rarely get to know which influencers are being funded by which companies. You don’t know what they are sub-consciously pushing on you. 
What’s worse is that these influencers are usually members of the working population who got lucky, or found a platform and format people liked, before they were rich nobody cared what they did, but as soon as they become successful they are welcomed into the elite circle with open arms, where other rich people can use them to manipulate massive numbers of people into buying things. 

And it gets worse, because some people worship these influencers, and copy them exactly, playing right into the hands of their sponsors. Why worship these people? They had a successful platform on which to make their own voice heard and the voice of their fans, and yet they sell out, they use their fan base to make as much money as possible. It’s an insult to people that support them.

Actually, I'll just quote it.

&gt; Please take martial arts. Like, I understand and you are a victim, I'm not trying to downplay that. However, for  
the future, you are stronger, faster, with quicker muscle fiber. I've had women try to be like this, and being able to catch their wrist or restrain them can save a lot of issues. It won't save you from words, or bad intentions or selfishness, but physical abuse, this one, as a male, you have the upper hand in, with a small amount of training it can never happen again. You will feel it in the air. This will give you healing as well.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like when people have a weakness, we all rush to make sure they are validated, their weakness acknowledged as ""OK"" and then we create an emotional bubble of support around the person, so they can heal.    Cool.  Good stuff.  But beyond that, how about recognizing a chink in the armor to prevent suffering, and taking some action to get better at life so that you remove the potentiality of this again.   Hell, with the self confidence that martial arts can provide, he probably wouldn't have attracted an abuser in the first place.    There are people who look for weak dogs so they can kick them.   While I treasure the soft things, the delicate, I champion them in others and in the soft places in myself, I have made some parts of me stronger, to protect those soft parts.  I hope for a world where someone can start soft, and if they choose, stay soft.   But I must say, there is so much growth that can occur on the path of 'getting stronger...'

African Americans need to look to other minorities and grow up.,"I work with an African American woman who constantly talks about how her failures (despite having the same job as me teaching English as a foreign language at a private academy in TOKYO JAPAN) are the fault of slavery and Jim Crow, and this sentiment is constantly repeated on TV, reddit, social media, etc.  Unfortunately that's not really the case if you look at historical examples.

Preface:  Pretty much everybody but white guys had it rough in the USA and I'm basing my opinion on how those groups responded to mistreatment/racism compared to african americans.


1. The Chinese and Japanese were brought over to do horribly dangerous, back breaking work such as mining gold, building railroads, general labor, etc.  The Japanese were eventually rounded up and lock in concentration camps for the sin of being Japanese.  Now they, filipinos, thai, indonesian, etc. are the highest per capita earners according to census.gov, and they dominate advanced degree programs.  They aren't wallowing in pity and excuses.

2. Hispanics are still treated horribly but one of the most common traits I saw living in a major US city with a high hispanic population was how hard working they are.  They try to demonstrate their worth the country, fight for equality, show that they can contribute more than just landscaping and construction work.

2. The big one: Jews.  They were enslaved, driven from their homelands, the victims of genocide during an era of modern civilization that literally had hand-held video cameras, and on-going hatred even in America with some notable cases of Jewish violence being perpetrated by african americans like Jesse Jackson who called the Himies and told an angry mob in New York to go burn down Jewish businesses.  **sidepoint** One theory of the origin of the word Kike is by Philip Cowen, first editor of ""The American Hebrew,"" suggesting a source in Yiddish kikel ""circle."" because so many Jews fleeing the holocaust were unable to even write their own names so they just drew a circle on their paperwork.   

Jews today are no killing each other over whether or not you have curly sideburns.  The Asian community isn't shooting 30 random people every weekend because someone made the wrong shape with their fingers.  Mexicans aren't refusing to participate in polite society and then blaming some Alex Jones level conspiracy theory.

Of course each circumstance is different but it isn't racist laws that make young black men shoot each other over the color of their bandanas.  It's not racist housing policies that led to the almost 70% single-motherhood rate in black families.  It aint mind control drugs in grape-koolaid that teaches young black men that violence is the answer to all your problems.  And it sure as shit aint the fault of a bunch of white kids and university students that black people are openly against the rights of minorities, especially when the white kids are almost 100% on the side of minorities and trying to make the world fairer for them.

And what also weirds me out is how hateful and hypocritical the black community is.  They want all the rights and privileges but fuck anyone who comes after them.  Not only were blacks one of the biggest groups to vote against gay marriage in California's prop 8 (7 out of 10 black voters didn't want gays to have equal rights), but even now about 50% of blacks are still openly against gay marriage according to Pew Research.  And while a good number of them claim to support protections for illegal immigrants, they also complain that Mexicans are stealing their jobs.  They also refuse to cooperate with police investigations which according to the dept of justice makes it harder to locate suspects and arrest the guilty party - to the point where we've had MULTIPLE cases of little kids being randomly shot in broad daylight, including at a birthday party, and somehow nobody saw who pulled the trigger, nobody saw what car it was, nobody saw nuffin.

Being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but I don't have a rally cry of support behind me,"My ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. 

Anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent.

As has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit.

In a lot of children's shows like Peppa Pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids,"Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. The girls save the day. I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile ""Mommy Pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.

Cardi B Drugging And Robbing Men Makes Her a Predator,"In a recently discovered online video, Cardi B claims “I had to go strip, I had to go, ‘Oh yeah, you want to fuck me? Yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go back to this hotel,’ and I drugged niggas up, and I robbed them. That’s what I used to do. "" 

That is the work of a predator. Maybe it isn't as bad as Bill Cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. Cardi B should not be a celebrated public figure.

Thanking God for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.,"I'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but I've seen enough posts and comments online. I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude). Also, I gotta be that person as I don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",unpopularopinion
Preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money,"Every fucking time I buy a frozen pizza, I put that sassy bitch in right when I start the oven. Why? Because I’ve figured it out. That’s right Uncle Sam, I’m onto you. 

The directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425F and cook for 15 minutes. My oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. So, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? No way. Not chance in hell, buckaroo. When I shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, I add 3-4 minutes to compensate. This means I wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. And guess what? It tastes fucking delicious. Ask any of my friends. I cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can’t get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. The pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. Source: I’ve been doing this for 12 years.

I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.

"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.","There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

Reddit gold is fucking stupid,"I mean really, who would actually pay real life money just to say they liked a post a bit more than average? Same goes for reddit silver/platinum, the fact that some people actually pay to give these to someone is just astonishing.

edit: no I did not make this post to get gold from people, this subreddit is for unpopular opinions so I posted what I consider to be an unpopular opinion.

edit 2: I honestly don’t know whether I should be happy or disappointed about the gold I got

edit 3: I don’t hate reddit gold. I think it’s stupid and I don’t care for it. People calling me a hypocrite for not taking this post down after I got all this gold don’t get my point. Gold makes no difference to the way I experience reddit, so I have no reason to care about it.",unpopularopinion
The right is just as easily triggered as the left,"I will probably be downvoted for this since this sub is dominated by right wingers venting their opinions, but for the record I am conservative myself.

I constantly hear talk about trigger culture where sjw's and feminist are sensitive to the point where any little thing they disagree with triggers them. It has become an internet meme and something that right wingers seem to throw around quite a lot. Yet these same right wingers go into an absolute trigger meltdown due to a silly Gillette commercial. The backlash to that commercial has pretty much been as big as the backlash to that ""black kid in a monkey sweater"" H&amp;M picture. I just find it funny that many of the same people who talk about triggered SJW's can't handle a fucking Gillette commercial.",unpopularopinion
Baby Boomers are the most entitled generation in US history.,"I know we have all heard and seen all the hatred on “snowflake millennials and generation z,” coming from baby boomers, but it’s completely unwarranted.

Boomers grew up right after WW2, which left them with an amazing economy and immense opportunity. People were able to afford a new car, a house and college from their full time jobs in their early 20s, which is why we catch all of this “well back when I was your age” bullshit. They were all able to keep stable jobs for 30 plus years, collect a good pension and collect social security and invest loads of money into flourishing assets and on top of it all, have a hearty savings built up, all while having a 4 year degree. We catch so much shit from boomers, because literally none of them understand how disgustingly bad inflation is right now, compared to when they were growing up. I remember having conversations with my grandparents, talking about how they bought a brand new corvette for 3,500 dollars, paid off their 30,000 dollar house and already had 30,000 in savings before they even turned 30, and neither of them graduated high school. Meanwhile, millennials are going to school for 6 years for bio mechanical engineering and then working as a fucking barista at minimum wage waiting for a job. Buying a car less than 10 years old costs anywhere from 12,000-20,000 dollars, let alone the gas prices, fees and taxes that we pay. Then, they live at a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other people doing almost exactly the same thing, and they all live on ramen noodles and shit. Our student debt reaches up to 130,000 depending on what kind of career we want, which all take us the rest of our lives to pay off, assuming we even get the job we paid to be qualified in. To make things worse, we have all of these young adults saying shit to appease the boomers like “I was born in the generation of pussies” or some shit like that. It’s disgusting to hear and see all the hatred we get from a generation who had their entire life given to them on a silver platter while we struggle to survive independently.

"If Tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.","Tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""You go girl!"", ""Girl power!"", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""Asshole!"", ""So misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9""** 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"If someone tells you ""I'll pray for you"" with sincerity, and you respond with a rude comment about religion, you're an asshole.","While I'm not sure just how unpopular this opinion is, I'm putting it in this sub because I've seen it happen so many times recently.

Don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for ""helping"" and so they pull the ""I'll pray"" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

But that is why I added ""with sincerity."" If they can't help, if there's nothing they can do, all they can do is appeal to the highest power they know. If you don't believe in their god, or a god at all, that's totally fine. But don't be fucking rude about it.",unpopularopinion
Orange juice with pulp is better than orange juice without pulp,"I like the way the orange bits goes down my throat, and it gives me a sense that this juice hasn't been tinkered with as much as the other juice.. for the other juice, the people making it have to sift through the goodness, and the juice is no longer in its natural form.

And a bit of orange rind and bits makes the juice a lot more interesting, rather than just a regular liquid.",unpopularopinion
"Whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.","https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

#edit 2: Omg thanks for the gold guys, I really appreciate it! Omg I also got gilding! Thank you stranger. I am so blessed. I love you!

edit 3: Google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". I dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. Claiming I'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually WORSE because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

Being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

Go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

&gt;its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

&gt;also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

&gt;should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

&gt;society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

For anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

&gt;I live in aus and about 11 years ago I used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with America, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the US for one summer. She went over there an had an inappropriate ‘romance’ with a camp attendee. He was 15 and she was 20. The boys parents found out and had her charged. She went to a women’s prison in Iowa. Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home. She is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. She is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. She is banned from ever travelling to the US. IMO she got what she deserved.

Alcohol is overrated and drinking in General is not that fun.,"I personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me I personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. I never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am I missing something ?

And before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends I doubt that since I have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. Hes probably part of the reason I dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

Im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something I couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

Kevin Hart Should NOT have stepped down over what he said in 2008,"Dear Americans,

The death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.,"Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

- of course  it depends on the situation, that’s why a put “generally”.
- it’s not a competition but it doesn’t mean things can’t be discussed 
- English is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit I’m sorry but couldn’t care less.

The whole if “you stay with your parents past 18 you are a loser” needs to stop.,"I got kicked out the day I turned 18. Why? My parents think that should be the culture.

Men who leave after learning their kids aren't theirs aren't doing anything wrong,"I was reading a post saying that if a man is with a woman raising a family and she tells him the kids aren't his, that he would be in the wrong to leave because ""the kid is innocent"" and that he is still obligated to be a parent to that kid because the woman trapped him by lying to him.

So as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

Alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn’t have the social acceptance it does.,"Alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I’ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don’t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify I don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly.

Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian.

There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",unpopularopinion
"I don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.","Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

&gt;That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&amp;#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",unpopularopinion

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals.

Swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.,"When you swim in denim jeans it’s like you’re an armored aquatic creature. The way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. Feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they’re soaking wet.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men","It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",unpopularopinion

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",unpopularopinion

Fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick,"I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. I'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but I'm well inside the 'normal' BMI range (BMI of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations.

It’s fine to not like them, it’s fine to not want to be around them, and it’s certainly fine to not want to have them.

What some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. Constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. Even if you’re not saying it to their face, even if they’re too young to even understand you — you’re just an asshole. 

Also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. They have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. They are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. And just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

Life would be better without sexual desire,"Sex make life a lot more complicated than it has to be, and ultimately sex is more trouble than it is worth. 

Sex makes people objectify others, hate others for their sexual orientation, and act irrationally. The most intimate moments between two people should be during a conversation, not when one is slamming into the other. Two people can be driven apart by sexual incompatibility even if everything else checks out.

If humans did not have an overwhelming compulsion to have sex, mankind would be much better off. And it's unfortunate that they do.

EDIT: 

I'm seeing a lot of two particular comments, and I'd like to address them because they are repetitive and make untrue assumptions. 

 **There would be no people without sexual desire** 

That might have been true in the Stone Age, but we have IVF now if you don't want to do the act. Perhaps the birth rate would go down if people suddenly had no desire to have sex tomorrow, but that would also eliminate almost all unwanted children. At any rate, my suggestion is that it would be better (as some has figured out) if people evolved beyond having to reproduce because of sexual desire. Obviously, if we rewind human history to its origins, there would be no people without sexual desire, and I will concede that.

 **Sex is responsible for the closeness between couples**

I don't deny that sex can make two people close because of the hormones involved, but I don't think that makes sexual desire worth it when you consider the negatives I mentioned. Plato believed that love between brothers was more sincere than the love between sexual partners because it was there without lust, and I agree with that.

EDIT 2: 

I've noticed a third item that should also be addressed.

**The motivation of men to do anything is so they can get laid**

There are probably thousands of counterexamples to this, but the first one that comes to mind is the work of Michelangelo, This is a gay guy who never allowed himself to have sex or really any physically intimate contact with other men. One of the greatest artists of all time, despite the fact that he obviously wasn't working toward the goal of getting laid, because that was never on the table for him.",unpopularopinion

I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/NotTheOnion, r/TIFU, r/ELI5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all.

"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.","Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is.

The problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.,"Negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

This happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

Unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

This is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

I would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

We need to let some pet breeds die out.,"We have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

I don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. People know I'm gay, and you know how much homophobia I've experienced in my life? ZERO. Not even from ultra conservative people.

I talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. No one bats an eye. I don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. No one feels weirded out in my presence.

Much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. It's not even really a fear. More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

It's ok to be weird. It's ok to be offensive. It's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. Just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. Because you are odd.

"If you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide","It's the same concept IMO.

It's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (Shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). Obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

Edit: 

A lot of people are agreeing and saying ""I agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" My entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

"If it’s socially acceptable for women to put “Sorry, no short men” as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say “Sorry, no flat-chested women”, or “no overweight women” in theirs.","I understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. That’s fine. You are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that.

However, if a man were to say  “Sorry, no (blank)  women”, they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

It’s a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. Whereas someone would say of the woman “Oh, she’s just very selective and knows what she wants”, they would say of the man “What a pig!

"Marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.","You've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the U.S. end in divorce. You've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
This is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. The reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of Disney fairytale. What a joke. But this is really ingrained in our culture. Think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. They take commitment. They take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

What does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*It means... not scrolling through the Facebook or IG pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. Saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if I was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*It means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""She/he was mean to me."" ""I deserve this."" ""She doesnt love me anyway. I can sleep with someone else now."" - Nope. you made a commitment. Stick by it and work on your issues.

\*It means... putting down the video games, the TV controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*It means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few examples of things I see so often that kill marriages. The truth is that marriage between 2 people can be amazing and last a lifetime, but you have to work hard at it and ignore a lot of what our selfish, hyper-consumer culture tells us about how to behave.",unpopularopinion
John Lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.,"He was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  Lennon resented his son Julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. After Lennon divorced his wife, he took off with Yoko Ono and dropped out of his son’s life for years. Julian has stated that Paul McCartney was far more of a father to him than John ever was. 

John was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in Liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. He often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. He claimed to have met Yoko Ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, Ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

John claimed to have lost interest in the Beatles due to Paul McCartney’s tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. Together, he and Yoko  destroyed the Beatles, then he blamed the breakup on Paul McCartney. 

He was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the Black Panthers.

He was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
His song writing was no better;  The lyrics to Strawberry Fields Forever and Come Together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

Lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as I say, not as I do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. All you have to do is look at his songs. Lennon, who sang Imagine no Possessions lived a millionaire’s life in a posh New York hotel.  Lennon sang Imagine no Religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and New Age fad that came along, including Hindu meditation, the I-Ching, and astrology of all kinds.  And it was Lennon who sang All you need is Love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. And it was Lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

"Assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist","Basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
BUT:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way

IMO they are both abusing someone who has no say in their health regards and are exposing them to possible health issues in the future.

This is not even taking into consideration the lack of self esteem and bullying the child might endure growing up.

I’m tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from “woke” POC and LGBTQ+ communities,"I’m a pansexual black/Cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. Throughout these 5 years I’ve seen so many people who swore they were “woke” proceed to do a poem that isn’t much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. At the end of these poems, most POC go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they’ve done nothing but try to be an ally. 

This kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  A person of color can post anything about white people. They can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying “I hate white people” and be fine. Same thing with queer people and straight people. 

And I get it. I’m Black, Cuban, queer, and a woman. I’m made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. My gender has been put down for centuries. I would’ve had to force myself into the closet if I was born a couple of centuries earlier. I know what it’s like to be hated for who I am. I know what it’s like to feel angry for what’s been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. But I don’t compliment these poems. I don’t applaud. I don’t like these posts. Because it’s wrong. This is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. This is all just tit for tat. 

You’re not woke if you:

- Make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can’t take it back in your direction. 

-Use generalizations like “all white people” or “all straight people” but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like “all black people” or “all queer people. 

-Refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they’re a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn’t want to interact with you because you’re a queer person of color. 

-Push allies away when they’re trying to help you. 

-Think you’re better than anyone because of your identity. 

Everyone has the right to be who they want. To be proud of their identity. You have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn’t be hated and put down for it. But you shouldn’t put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

Next time you write a status or a poem about the “other” side, insert blanks on every time you name them. Insert something represents you into the blanks. Then read the poem and visualize someone from the “other” side reading it back to you. Do you feel put down? That’s what you’re doing to others. 


TLDR: Love yourself but don’t put other people down in the process.

Schools should not punish bullied kids for fighting back.,"If a kid gets physically hurt by a bully, I believe defending oneself should be allowed, since a slap on the wrist/detention will do almost nothing to make the bully ""see the light"" in his wrongdoings. A lot of people tend to disagree with this calling it barbaric, but why should a provoked kid who kept to himself be punished if he's reacting to what happened? Also, the school's way of punishing a bully tends to be very counterproductive in general.

A 'dislike' button on Facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better,"The title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but I do believe this to be true. The absence of a dislike button on Facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and I believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


The only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an Angry emoji or comment. The angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. Commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. Giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


Imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? You might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. This sends out the wrong message. This tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. Add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


It would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, I think it is IMPORTANT.  


Yes I know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. It influences people, some people live on there. Facebook impacts the world.

Accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty.,"With the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. As the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

Naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. Obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. However with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. This can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable.",unpopularopinion

Making fun of someone for having a small dick is just as bad as discriminating someone for their skin colour.,"Small dick jokes are getting really boring now. Someone has a small dick... So what? They don't have control over how big it is. It is in their genes. Nothing can be done about it.




Edit: maybe more like being discriminated for your height. I couldn't think of any type of silly discrimination when i typed this out. Apologies for making a ridiculous comparison. 

#Edit 2: I don't have a small dick. Stop commenting/messaging OP has a small pp. 

Edit 3: I can't change the header content. Stop mentioning that i made a ridiculous comparison. I have acknowledged it and given it an explanation. Now move the fuck on.",unpopularopinion
I want the right to fucking die a painless death,"I don’t want to be crippled with fourth stage cancer and dementia to get your fucking permission to die. Forcing me to live against my will is as cruel as it is self righteous, and if you’re going to stop me from getting myself a humane way of dying, then I am going to be forced to do it in a much more painful way like jumping off a cliff or hanging myself, and given that death almost never occurs “instantly”, I’d be awaiting an incredibly fucking inhumane amount of pain for a minute or five of them. And before you say something about doctors being forced to help with this, make it so that doctors who are willing to help with euthanasia or assisted suicide only do so willingly and without pressure from anyone else.",unpopularopinion
An Artist Should Not Win a Grammy if Their Songs Have 5+ Writers,"It’s a shame that most Grammys are going to artists who don’t even write their own music. Look at how many credited writers there are on Cardi B’s album. They put no true heart into their work 

Edit: Lots of posts about Bands. I believe that is different because they are all true members, not artificial writers to produce whatever is going to make the most money. Even then, there are usually one 1 or 2 member that do the writing.",unpopularopinion
"""Money can't buy happiness"" is the biggest bullshit statement of the past hundred years.","For almost every normal person in the world, money CAN buy happiness. The only case where this doesn't exist is with people that are SEVERELY depressed to the point that nothing matters anymore. For almost everyone else, a new car, house, medical care, medication, etc is what they need to be happy. ""Money can't buy happiness"" seems to be something invented by people who have never had the pleasure of experiencing what it truly means to have enough money to do and buy what you want.",unpopularopinion
Following subreddit rules don't mean shit if the mods have a hate boner for anyone that disagrees with their worldview.,"You could follow subreddit rules and general reddit rules all you want, but the fate of your post depends on which mod is gonna look at your post. If that mod doesn't like your post, be it for political differences or otherwise, they are not gonna let it through or delete it.

There is literally nothing you can do about it that will produce any reasonable outcome. Messaging and asking them would result in them replying with some bullshit which translates to ""fuck off"".

There needs to be ""super mods"" or some group of people who keep the mods of various subreddits accountable otherwise it's just dictatorship.

Being politically ignorant and living under a rock is much more healthy and satisfying.,"I’ve always felt this way as I never get involved in politics or share an opinion on political issues. I don’t watch the news (even though i work at a news stations) I just do what I want to do and pay attention to what interests me. 

I recently saw that the most recent presidency has caused many people mental health issues and I can’t fathom why anyone would let politics affect their mental state. 

Edit: I was referencing an article that appeared on the popular page of Reddit yesterday. For those asking, I do not have the link but perhaps somebody else saw it has easy access to it. I am not claiming that people engaging in politics have mental issues.

If your child is fat it's your fault and you're a bad parent.,"Obviously there's a handful of medical conditions that are exceptions, but if your child is otherwise healthy, it's your fault. 

You are their caretaker, you control most of what they eat, and you control their physical activity to a great extent. 

If your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

You're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

Edit: I'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

I understand that (at least in the States) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. For the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


And on taking kids away from parents I agree there should be some steps before that happens. There should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. But if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.",unpopularopinion
Pineapple on pizza isn't even slightly weird. Sweet and savory is one of the most common and proven food combinations. The whole controversy surrounding is just about flexing some sort of pizza elitism,"I'm *not* saying that you're lying if you say you don't like it. It's completely valid to not like it. But the fact that it's such a big deal is annoying. I'm from Italy and people always expect me to be furiously anti-pineapple, but it's whatever ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",unpopularopinion

Unattractive people should learn to accept that they’re not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,"“Everybody is beautiful to somebody.” 

“Ugly doesn’t exist.” 

“Everybody is equally attractive in their own way.” 

“Looks don’t even matter. What’s on the inside determines whether you’re attractive or not.”

“You’re perfect just the way you are.” 


These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It’s like everyone needs to believe they’re attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person’s only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn’t fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that’s nobody’s fault, but that’s just the way it is. 

Before you say “beauty is subjective”, you can’t deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I’ve yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder “what am I doing wrong?” when they find that others don’t view them how they view themselves.",unpopularopinion
sleeping in jeans is amazing,"I absolutely cannot stand sweatpants, pj's, shorts, etc.

sweatpants are WAY too hot, pj's just feel gross and tickly, and shorts are just bad.

I am fully incapable of sleeping if I'm not either basically nude, or in jeans.

they are super comfortable on the legs, not too hot, don't have some dumbass string you either gotta tie up or feel rubbing your stomach.

jeans are THE BEST pants for sleeping in",unpopularopinion
"A lot of the heavily-downvoted posts on this website are usually good points, and they only receive criticism because they go against a sub's ""hivemind"" mentality","Just something I've noticed a lot on here. Almost every sub has just turned into an echo chamber, and even when someone makes a good point that goes against the collective consciousness, it gets mass downvoted and ridiculed without even a second thought. People identify so much with their opinions that they take any contradicting argument as a personal attack, and it's a really shitty way to interact with others.",unpopularopinion
I don't care that my bully has a troubled home life.,"I spent years of my life being tormented by kids in my school.  I got my food spit in, my backpack stolen, slammed into lockers, one of my Magic cards ripped to pieces in the lunchroom, beat up, a rumor started about me that I have a tail, the list goes on.  People on Reddit are so quick to try and find an out for bullies. ""Oh, something bad has to be happening to them at home.  Their parents probably abuse them.""  NOTHING excuses someone from the way that they treated me.  If I wasn't so afraid of leaving my siblings behind, I would have killed myself.  I absolutely do not care why you ended up being a bully. Being a child doesn't mean that you don't understand the difference between right and wrong.  Even animals understand when people are upset.  If you revel in someone else's torment, you are a huge piece of shit and need to be taught a lesson.  This leads to my next point.  If you are an adult witnessing bullying and do nothing about it, you should be charged with criminal negligence.  If the bullied child dies, that blood is on your hands.  So many adults didn't do shit about my bullies because they were athletes and our teams couldn't afford to lose them.  
Quit finding excuses for bullies.",unpopularopinion
If you can’t feed’em don’t breed’em.,"Its not responsible tax payers job to pay for your children. If you can’t afford kids don’t have them. Paying people more money per month for every child they have and can’t support is a stupid policy that incentivizes people to keep having kids. If you’ve already got two you can’t afford... stop fucking having kids. 

Make birth control mandatory for those who receive government assistance. Grandfather those who are already on assistance. No kids starve and no new kids are born to parents who cannot support them. 

Edit: I’m not an expert but when I was in high school in 2006 living in flint Michigan I had access to free birth control and unlimited condoms at the city health clinic. 

Double Edit: For those wondering my stance on abortion.

If you can’t Support’em ... Abort’em.

Sending food to countries that can’t feed themselves only makes the problem worse. The root of the problem is these people can’t feed themselves. Feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can’t be fed. Either teach these people to farm or let them starve. If they aren’t capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

Parts of Africa are like the crazy cat lady. She sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. Pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. What started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. She hasn’t solved a problem she just made it worse. She had good intentions but didn’t stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.",unpopularopinion
