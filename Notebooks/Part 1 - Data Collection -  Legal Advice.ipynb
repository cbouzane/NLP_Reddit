She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.\\n\\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\\n\\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\\n\\nIf it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. \\n\\nI feel good for following all the advice here.\\n\\n\",\n",

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \\n\\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \\n\\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… \\n\\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \\n\\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \\n\\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\\n\\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \\n\\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \\n\\nThe next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \\n\\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \\n\\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \\n\\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \\n\\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \\n',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Male, late 20’s, CO\\n\\nI quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven’t consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. \\nHere lies my issue:\\nThis morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter’s car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like “The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby.” As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone’s screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I’m calling the cops. Any suggestions?\\n\\nBTW, I didn’t get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their “duty” to protect the community.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nThe police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. \\n\\nUPDATE #2:\\n\\nBoth men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ',\n",

She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. \\n\\nThere were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now.

I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all.

He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.\\n\\nThen it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver.

       "     'selftext': '**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**\\n\\n[Here\\'s my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)\\n\\nSo after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.\\n\\nI did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I\\'ve ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad\\'s death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she\\'d do everything she possibly could to help me.\\n\\nAfter my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn\\'t have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn\\'t visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered \"abandonment\" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.\\n\\nAfter her bio dad said he didn\\'t want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I\\'ve never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.\\n\\nHer bio dad didn\\'t ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn\\'t even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.\\n\\nYesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We\\'re both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she\\'s asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.\\n\\nThe past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that\\'s ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I\\'ve ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn\\'t just DNA based, it\\'s actionable investments in the life of someone you love.\\n\\nThank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya\\'ll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.\\n\\nI hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my original post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I&amp;#39;ve ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad&amp;#39;s death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she&amp;#39;d do everything she possibly could to help me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn&amp;#39;t have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn&amp;#39;t visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered &amp;quot;abandonment&amp;quot; in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After her bio dad said he didn&amp;#39;t want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I&amp;#39;ve never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Her bio dad didn&amp;#39;t ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn&amp;#39;t even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We&amp;#39;re both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she&amp;#39;s asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that&amp;#39;s ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I&amp;#39;ve ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn&amp;#39;t just DNA based, it&amp;#39;s actionable investments in the life of someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya&amp;#39;ll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.\\n\\nI went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. \\n\\nI panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. \\n\\nLong story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.\\n\\nAnyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation.

       "     'selftext': \"FINAL UPDATE\\n\\nSo I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \\n\\n&lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      \\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE:\\nHey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!\\n\\nMy location is Washington DC\\n\",\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINAL UPDATE&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn&amp;#39;t get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;FINAL UPDATE:\\nHey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM&amp;#39;ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My location is Washington DC&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.\\n\\nSo, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.\\n\\n(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)\\n\\nMy brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.\\n\\nDuring the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.\\n\\nSuffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.\\n\\nSo, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.\",\n",

During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it&amp;#39;s was worth a total of 2,200$.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn&amp;#39;t realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won&amp;#39;t elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t need pity. I&amp;#39;m doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She\\'s an anti-vaxxer and and doesn\\'t trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife\\'s anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus\\'s including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAround this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEx had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to \"lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn\\'t poison her.\" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the \"secret mommy promised to make her keep\".\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTurns out my ex didn\\'t vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using \"Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick.\" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn\\'t know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I\\'m planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do.

Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife&amp;#39;s anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus&amp;#39;s including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to &amp;quot;lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn&amp;#39;t poison her.&amp;quot; I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the &amp;quot;secret mommy promised to make her keep&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out my ex didn&amp;#39;t vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using &amp;quot;Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick.&amp;quot; What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn&amp;#39;t know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I&amp;#39;m planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Past post:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&amp;sh=7aebba6a \\n\\nOh boy. I\\'ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn\\'t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don\\'t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). \\n\\nFor those who didn\\'t see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I\\'m going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:\\n \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;sh=badbe0c6 \\n\\nFirst, I want to assure everyone that I didn\\'t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don\\'t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I\\'m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don\\'t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don\\'t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. \\n\\nI was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don\\'t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn\\'t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn\\'t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt\\'s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. \\n\\nAfter moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn\\'t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn\\'t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn\\'t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can\\'t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn\\'t \"look\" like an abuser or because I wasn\\'t \"like\" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn\\'t one. But I am. I can\\'t take back what I\\'ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I\\'ve learned this behavior and it\\'s voluntary, it\\'s totally within my control to change it. I\\'ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don\\'t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). \\n\\nThank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I\\'m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.\\n\\n**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn\\'t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:\\n\\n1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn\\'t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. \\n\\n2. I didn\\'t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I\\'m not sure why I did it, but I don\\'t think \"congrats\" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don\\'t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. \\n\\n3. I\\'ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I\\'d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google \"batterer intervention programs in my area.\" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don\\'t think.\\n\\n4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real \"friends\" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say \"oh I\\'m perfect now so I can do what I want,\" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as \"that creepy kid\" at my new college. \\n\\nPlease get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ',\n",

I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First, I want to assure everyone that I didn&amp;#39;t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don&amp;#39;t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I&amp;#39;m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don&amp;#39;t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn&amp;#39;t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn&amp;#39;t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt&amp;#39;s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn&amp;#39;t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn&amp;#39;t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn&amp;#39;t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can&amp;#39;t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; like an abuser or because I wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn&amp;#39;t one. But I am. I can&amp;#39;t take back what I&amp;#39;ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I&amp;#39;ve learned this behavior and it&amp;#39;s voluntary, it&amp;#39;s totally within my control to change it. I&amp;#39;ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don&amp;#39;t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I&amp;#39;m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow, just wow. I didn&amp;#39;t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read every single comment in &lt;a href=\"/r/bestoflegaladvice\"&gt;r/bestoflegaladvice&lt;/a&gt; even though I didn&amp;#39;t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I&amp;#39;m not sure why I did it, but I don&amp;#39;t think &amp;quot;congrats&amp;quot; is quite the right thing to say to me. I don&amp;#39;t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I&amp;#39;d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google &amp;quot;batterer intervention programs in my area.&amp;quot; I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don&amp;#39;t think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say &amp;quot;oh I&amp;#39;m perfect now so I can do what I want,&amp;quot; trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as &amp;quot;that creepy kid&amp;quot; at my new college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)\\n\\nI sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.\\n\\nThe place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.\\n\\nUntil they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.\\n\\nThey knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.\\n\\nThey got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.\\n\\nFrom there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.\\n\\nWhen I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.\\n\\nMy big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.\\n\\nThat's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. \",\n",

I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don&amp;#39;t agree that you&amp;#39;re ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren&amp;#39;t convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I&amp;#39;m broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn&amp;#39;t care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She&amp;#39;d tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn&amp;#39;t ready.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn&amp;#39;t working anymore and told me that they&amp;#39;ve deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From there I didn&amp;#39;t care anymore and they were convinced they&amp;#39;ve achieved their goal. So things became easier. They&amp;#39;d teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children&amp;#39;s book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn&amp;#39;t deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn&amp;#39;t good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m the same person or not or how much I&amp;#39;ve changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn&amp;#39;t even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I&amp;#39;m 18 and I&amp;#39;m counting every single day until this is over and then I&amp;#39;m leaving with my brother and we&amp;#39;re never looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn&amp;#39;t access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn&amp;#39;t lose subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn&amp;#39;t afford to keep me there anymore that&amp;#39;s why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad.

       "     'selftext': 'Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\\\\_i\\\\_take\\\\_prescription\\\\_medication\\\\_for\\\\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)\\n\\nI am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.\\n\\nI met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don\\'t want to sue anyone if I don\\'t have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed\\n\\nUltimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn\\'t know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just \"suspended\" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being \"honest\" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don\\'t waste each other\\'s time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.\\n\\nI asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn\\'t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then \"maybe\" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.\\n\\nAnyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.\\n\\nWhen I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.\\n\\nHe told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.\\n\\nSo now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I\\'m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it\\'s not as \"intense\" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn\\'t give me the \"crash\" that Adderall does when wearing off.

I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.\\n\\nThe bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. \\n\\nThank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. \",\n",

I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don&amp;#39;t even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don&amp;#39;t have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don&amp;#39;t know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won&amp;#39;t fight back since my health was very poor at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that, I&amp;#39;m dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it&amp;#39;s now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I&amp;#39;m happy with the life I&amp;#39;ve lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). \\n\\nWe watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.\\n\\nThe officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.\\n\\nAfter they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.\\n\\nI talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.\\n\\nI haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.\",\n",

       "     'selftext': 'This is in north Texas. \\n\\nHey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \\n\\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \\n\\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… \\n\\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \\n\\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \\n\\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\\n\\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \\n\\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \\n\\nThe next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \\n\\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \\n\\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \\n\\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \\n\\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \\n',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in north Texas. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.\\n\\nHe called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.\\n\\nWe went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. \\n\\nThere were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. \\n\\nI should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.\\n\\nI hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me.\",\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn&amp;#39;t tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn&amp;#39;t because I told him I&amp;#39;d run away and call the police if he did.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they&amp;#39;d already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn&amp;#39;t make me feel ashamed at all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we&amp;#39;re illegal. She wasn&amp;#39;t there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don&amp;#39;t know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that&amp;#39;s what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they&amp;#39;re gonna look into it though. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we&amp;#39;d stay for now. Like a shelter or something. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I should of done this year&amp;#39;s ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s happening or gonna happen but the place I&amp;#39;m in now is way cleaner than I&amp;#39;m used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don&amp;#39;t have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren&amp;#39;t happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can&amp;#39;t read at all. They also weren&amp;#39;t very happy with our house I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope we don&amp;#39;t have to go back. And I hope it&amp;#39;s ok to post this. Even tho I don&amp;#39;t need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/\\n\\nSo as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.\\n\\nI went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. \\n\\nI panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. \\n\\nLong story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.\\n\\nAnyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. \",\n",

I thought I would update now that it&amp;#39;s come to a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter&amp;#39;s birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn&amp;#39;t really allowed to know about.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won&amp;#39;t be getting out anytime soon, plus I&amp;#39;m getting married in a few months and I&amp;#39;ll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I&amp;#39;d update here with the good news! I was afraid that I&amp;#39;d be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \\n\\n&lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      \\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE:\\nHey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.

I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.\\n\\nSo, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.\\n\\n(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)\\n\\nMy brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.\\n\\nDuring the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.\\n\\nSuffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.\\n\\nSo, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.\",\n",

He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. \\n\\n\\nI phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible. \\n\\n\\nLocation: New Jersey, USA\\n \\n\\nEdit: Thank you for all your assistance. I have contacted a lawyer who has represented my interests in the past and have been advised to not speak further until paperwork can be filed with the necessary courts.

He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I&amp;#39;m hearing about it. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn&amp;#39;t want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn&amp;#39;t want to go back home, I&amp;#39;m perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he&amp;#39;s loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Location: New Jersey, USA&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for all your assistance. I have contacted a lawyer who has represented my interests in the past and have been advised to not speak further until paperwork can be filed with the necessary courts. Thank you for your time and support in this time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

They said they will speak with the school.\\n\\nI was called into school and the principal\\'s office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it\\'s another perfect score and wanted to leave.\\n\\nI said loudly \"I think you owe me an apology.\"\\n\\nShe said \"yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.\"\\n\\nI said \"Yes, and another apology for saying I don\\'t have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.\"\\n\\nShe said \"I\\'m sorry\" and left.\\n\\nThe principal said \"don\\'t push your luck kid.\"\\n\\nI said \"It wasn\\'t luck, and you also owe me an apology.\"\\n\\nHe apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won\\'t go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn\\'t give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.\\n\\nSo things are sorted out now. But also, I\\'m not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them.

I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent&amp;#39;s office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was called into school and the principal&amp;#39;s office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it&amp;#39;s another perfect score and wanted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said loudly &amp;quot;I think you owe me an apology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;Yes, and another apology for saying I don&amp;#39;t have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot; and left.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The principal said &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t push your luck kid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t luck, and you also owe me an apology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won&amp;#39;t go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn&amp;#39;t give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So things are sorted out now. But also, I&amp;#39;m not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Past post:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&amp;sh=7aebba6a \\n\\nOh boy. I\\'ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn\\'t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don\\'t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). \\n\\nFor those who didn\\'t see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I\\'m going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:\\n \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;sh=badbe0c6 \\n\\nFirst, I want to assure everyone that I didn\\'t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don\\'t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I\\'m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don\\'t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don\\'t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. \\n\\nI was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don\\'t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn\\'t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn\\'t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt\\'s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. \\n\\nAfter moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn\\'t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn\\'t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn\\'t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can\\'t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn\\'t \"look\" like an abuser or because I wasn\\'t \"like\" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn\\'t one. But I am. I can\\'t take back what I\\'ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I\\'ve learned this behavior and it\\'s voluntary, it\\'s totally within my control to change it. I\\'ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don\\'t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). \\n\\nThank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I\\'m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.\\n\\n**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn\\'t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:\\n\\n1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn\\'t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. \\n\\n2. I didn\\'t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I\\'m not sure why I did it, but I don\\'t think \"congrats\" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don\\'t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. \\n\\n3. I\\'ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I\\'d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google \"batterer intervention programs in my area.\" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don\\'t think.\\n\\n4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real \"friends\" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say \"oh I\\'m perfect now so I can do what I want,\" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as \"that creepy kid\" at my new college. \\n\\nPlease get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ',\n",

I&amp;#39;ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;, but they don&amp;#39;t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For those who didn&amp;#39;t see my original post on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt; before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I&amp;#39;m going to link to a thread from &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First, I want to assure everyone that I didn&amp;#39;t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don&amp;#39;t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I&amp;#39;m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don&amp;#39;t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn&amp;#39;t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn&amp;#39;t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt&amp;#39;s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn&amp;#39;t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn&amp;#39;t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn&amp;#39;t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can&amp;#39;t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; like an abuser or because I wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn&amp;#39;t one. But I am. I can&amp;#39;t take back what I&amp;#39;ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months.

What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)\\n\\nI sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.\\n\\nThe place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.\\n\\nUntil they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.\\n\\nThey knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.\\n\\nThey got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.\\n\\nFrom there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.\\n\\nWhen I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.\\n\\nMy big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.\\n\\nThat's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. \",\n",

All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad.

After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don\\'t want to sue anyone if I don\\'t have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed\\n\\nUltimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn\\'t know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just \"suspended\" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being \"honest\" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don\\'t waste each other\\'s time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.\\n\\nI asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn\\'t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then \"maybe\" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.\\n\\nAnyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.\\n\\nWhen I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.\\n\\nHe told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.\\n\\nSo now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I\\'m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it\\'s not as \"intense\" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn\\'t give me the \"crash\" that Adderall does when wearing off.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. \\n\\nI went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.\\n\\nI did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.\\n\\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\\n\\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\\n\\nIf it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. \\n\\nI feel good for following all the advice here.\\n\\n\",\n",

She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it&amp;#39;s clearly visible that she&amp;#39;s trying to take advantage of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I&amp;#39;ll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I feel good for following all the advice here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). \\n\\nWe watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.\\n\\nThe officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.\\n\\nAfter they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.\\n\\nI talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.\\n\\nI haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher).

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \\n\\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \\n\\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… \\n\\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \\n\\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \\n\\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\\n\\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \\n\\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \\n\\nThe next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \\n\\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \\n\\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \\n\\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \\n\\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \\n',\n",

My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter’s car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like “The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby.” As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone’s screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE.

At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.\\n\\nHe called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.\\n\\nWe went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. \\n\\nThere were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. \\n\\nI should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.\\n\\nI hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore.

Last week I went to court, and here\\'s what happened:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI brought copies of my cell phone\\'s call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver\\'s criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [\"justification\" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=18&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=5&amp;sctn=3&amp;subsctn=0).\\n\\nThe hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he \"went to investigate\" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.\\n\\nThen it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)\\n\\nFinally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.\\n\\nThe judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I\\'m going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said \"the law is the law.\" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!',\n",

I also got a copy of the drunk driver&amp;#39;s criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;amp;ttl=18&amp;amp;div=0&amp;amp;chpt=5&amp;amp;sctn=3&amp;amp;subsctn=0\"&gt;&amp;quot;justification&amp;quot; law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he &amp;quot;went to investigate&amp;quot; why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I&amp;#39;m going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said &amp;quot;the law is the law.&amp;quot; I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened \\n\\nTitle says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. \\n\\nShe got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. \\n\\nI love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. \\n\\nI know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. \\n\\n“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for &lt;X disease&gt; have risen alongside the increased use of &lt;Y vaccine&gt;”\\n\\n“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” \\n\\nI’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”\\n\\nI’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”\\n\\nShe won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. \\n\\nI am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. \\n\\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

       "    'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting this here as well as &lt;a href=\"/r/vaxxhappened\"&gt;r/vaxxhappened&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Title says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for &amp;lt;X disease&amp;gt; have risen alongside the increased use of &amp;lt;Y vaccine&amp;gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.\\n\\nAnyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex.

I lost my job, didn\\'t pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won\\'t release it.\\n\\nI was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I\\'m not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn\\'t even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I\\'m not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn\\'t say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don\\'t have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).\\n\\nSo then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn\\'t afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don\\'t really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can\\'t pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I\\'m about to owe.\\n\\nWhen he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a \"sorry, computer error you are free to go\" and I was released.\\n\\nWhat can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can\\'t even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I\\'ll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.\\n\\nEDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told \"good luck\". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.',\n",

Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can&amp;#39;t even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I&amp;#39;ll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told &amp;quot;good luck&amp;quot;. Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \\n\\n&lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      \\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.

I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.

Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.

       "    'selftext': \"So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.\\n\\nSo, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.\\n\\n(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)\\n\\nMy brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.\\n\\nDuring the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.\\n\\nSuffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.\\n\\nSo, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.\",\n",

I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent\\'s office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.\\n\\nI was called into school and the principal\\'s office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it\\'s another perfect score and wanted to leave.\\n\\nI said loudly \"I think you owe me an apology.\"\\n\\nShe said \"yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.\"\\n\\nI said \"Yes, and another apology for saying I don\\'t have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.\"\\n\\nShe said \"I\\'m sorry\" and left.\\n\\nThe principal said \"don\\'t push your luck kid.\"\\n\\nI said \"It wasn\\'t luck, and you also owe me an apology.\"\\n\\nHe apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won\\'t go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn\\'t give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.\\n\\nSo things are sorted out now. But also, I\\'m not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.\\n\\nThanks for pointing me in the right direction!',\n",

I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent&amp;#39;s office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was called into school and the principal&amp;#39;s office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it&amp;#39;s another perfect score and wanted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said loudly &amp;quot;I think you owe me an apology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;Yes, and another apology for saying I don&amp;#39;t have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot; and left.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The principal said &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t push your luck kid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t luck, and you also owe me an apology.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won&amp;#39;t go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn&amp;#39;t give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So things are sorted out now. But also, I&amp;#39;m not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I\\'ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn\\'t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don\\'t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). \\n\\nFor those who didn\\'t see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I\\'m going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:\\n \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;sh=badbe0c6 \\n\\nFirst, I want to assure everyone that I didn\\'t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don\\'t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I\\'m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don\\'t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don\\'t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. \\n\\nI was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don\\'t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn\\'t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn\\'t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt\\'s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. \\n\\nAfter moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn\\'t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn\\'t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn\\'t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can\\'t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn\\'t \"look\" like an abuser or because I wasn\\'t \"like\" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn\\'t one. But I am. I can\\'t take back what I\\'ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I\\'ve learned this behavior and it\\'s voluntary, it\\'s totally within my control to change it. I\\'ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don\\'t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). \\n\\nThank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I\\'m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.\\n\\n**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn\\'t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:\\n\\n1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn\\'t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. \\n\\n2. I didn\\'t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I\\'m not sure why I did it, but I don\\'t think \"congrats\" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don\\'t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. \\n\\n3. I\\'ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I\\'d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google \"batterer intervention programs in my area.\" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don\\'t think.\\n\\n4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real \"friends\" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say \"oh I\\'m perfect now so I can do what I want,\" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as \"that creepy kid\" at my new college. \\n\\nPlease get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ',\n",

I&amp;#39;ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;, but they don&amp;#39;t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For those who didn&amp;#39;t see my original post on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt; before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I&amp;#39;m going to link to a thread from &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First, I want to assure everyone that I didn&amp;#39;t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don&amp;#39;t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me.

What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)\\n\\nI sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.\\n\\nThe place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.\\n\\nUntil they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.\\n\\nThey knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.\\n\\nThey got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.\\n\\nFrom there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.\\n\\nWhen I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.\\n\\nMy big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.\\n\\nThat's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. \",\n",

All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad. I casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it. \\n\\nTLDR I think my dead sister is my real mom. In Florida btw.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\\\\_i\\\\_take\\\\_prescription\\\\_medication\\\\_for\\\\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)\\n\\nI am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.\\n\\nI met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don\\'t want to sue anyone if I don\\'t have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed\\n\\nUltimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn\\'t know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just \"suspended\" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being \"honest\" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don\\'t waste each other\\'s time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.\\n\\nI asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn\\'t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then \"maybe\" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.\\n\\nAnyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.\\n\\nWhen I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.\\n\\nHe told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.\\n\\nSo now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I\\'m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it\\'s not as \"intense\" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn\\'t give me the \"crash\" that Adderall does when wearing off.

I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I&amp;#39;m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it&amp;#39;s not as &amp;quot;intense&amp;quot; as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn&amp;#39;t give me the &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; that Adderall does when wearing off. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. \\n\\nI went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.\\n\\nI did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.\\n\\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\\n\\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\\n\\nIf it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. \\n\\nI feel good for following all the advice here.\\n\\n\",\n",

She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it&amp;#39;s clearly visible that she&amp;#39;s trying to take advantage of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I&amp;#39;ll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I feel good for following all the advice here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). \\n\\nWe watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.\\n\\nThe officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.\\n\\nAfter they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.\\n\\nI talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.\\n\\nI haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.\",\n",

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \\n\\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \\n\\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… \\n\\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \\n\\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \\n\\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\\n\\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \\n\\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \\n\\nThe next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \\n\\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \\n\\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \\n\\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \\n\\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \\n',\n",

I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.\\n\\nHe called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.\\n\\nWe went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. \\n\\nThere were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. \\n\\nI should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.\\n\\nI hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me.\",\n",

Last week I went to court, and here\\'s what happened:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI brought copies of my cell phone\\'s call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver\\'s criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [\"justification\" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=18&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=5&amp;sctn=3&amp;subsctn=0).\\n\\nThe hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he \"went to investigate\" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.\\n\\nThen it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)\\n\\nFinally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.\\n\\nThe judge agreed and found me not guilty!

       "   'selftext': 'Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened \\n\\nTitle says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. \\n\\nShe got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. \\n\\nI love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. \\n\\nI know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. \\n\\n“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for &lt;X disease&gt; have risen alongside the increased use of &lt;Y vaccine&gt;”\\n\\n“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” \\n\\nI’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”\\n\\nI’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”\\n\\nShe won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. \\n\\nI am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. \\n\\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for &amp;lt;X disease&amp;gt; have risen alongside the increased use of &amp;lt;Y vaccine&amp;gt;”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. \\n\\nI panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. \\n\\nLong story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.\\n\\nAnyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. \",\n",

They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. \\n\\n&lt;EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      \\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.

I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.

Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.

       "   'selftext': \"So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.\\n\\nSo, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.\\n\\n(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)\\n\\nMy brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.\\n\\nDuring the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.\\n\\nSuffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.\\n\\nSo, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.\",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I&amp;#39;m not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I&amp;#39;m here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn&amp;#39;t help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We&amp;#39;re just to different in some senses. He&amp;#39;s a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i&amp;#39;m the exact opposite. In these past few years we&amp;#39;ve tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn&amp;#39;t see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn&amp;#39;t feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don&amp;#39;t feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about that. Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it&amp;#39;s was worth a total of 2,200$.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brother said he plans to not sue us.

But my grandson doesn&amp;#39;t want to go back home, I&amp;#39;m perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he&amp;#39;s loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Location: New Jersey, USA&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you for all your assistance. I have contacted a lawyer who has represented my interests in the past and have been advised to not speak further until paperwork can be filed with the necessary courts. Thank you for your time and support in this time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She\\'s an anti-vaxxer and and doesn\\'t trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife\\'s anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus\\'s including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAround this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEx had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to \"lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn\\'t poison her.\" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school.

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She&amp;#39;s an anti-vaxxer and and doesn&amp;#39;t trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife&amp;#39;s anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus&amp;#39;s including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to &amp;quot;lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn&amp;#39;t poison her.&amp;quot; I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the &amp;quot;secret mommy promised to make her keep&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out my ex didn&amp;#39;t vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using &amp;quot;Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick.&amp;quot; What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn&amp;#39;t know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this.

       "   'selftext': 'Past post:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&amp;sh=7aebba6a \\n\\nOh boy. I\\'ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn\\'t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don\\'t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). \\n\\nFor those who didn\\'t see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I\\'m going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:\\n \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;sh=badbe0c6 \\n\\nFirst, I want to assure everyone that I didn\\'t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don\\'t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I\\'m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don\\'t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don\\'t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. \\n\\nI was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don\\'t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn\\'t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn\\'t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt\\'s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. \\n\\nAfter moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn\\'t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn\\'t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn\\'t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can\\'t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn\\'t \"look\" like an abuser or because I wasn\\'t \"like\" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn\\'t one. But I am. I can\\'t take back what I\\'ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I\\'ve learned this behavior and it\\'s voluntary, it\\'s totally within my control to change it. I\\'ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don\\'t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). \\n\\nThank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I\\'m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.\\n\\n**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn\\'t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:\\n\\n1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn\\'t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. \\n\\n2. I didn\\'t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I\\'m not sure why I did it, but I don\\'t think \"congrats\" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don\\'t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. \\n\\n3. I\\'ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I\\'d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google \"batterer intervention programs in my area.\" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don\\'t think.\\n\\n4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real \"friends\" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say \"oh I\\'m perfect now so I can do what I want,\" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as \"that creepy kid\" at my new college. \\n\\nPlease get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ',\n",

I&amp;#39;ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;, but they don&amp;#39;t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For those who didn&amp;#39;t see my original post on &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt; before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I&amp;#39;m going to link to a thread from &lt;a href=\"/r/niceguys\"&gt;r/niceguys&lt;/a&gt; from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&amp;amp;sh=badbe0c6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First, I want to assure everyone that I didn&amp;#39;t contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don&amp;#39;t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I&amp;#39;m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don&amp;#39;t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn&amp;#39;t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn&amp;#39;t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt&amp;#39;s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn&amp;#39;t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn&amp;#39;t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn&amp;#39;t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can&amp;#39;t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; like an abuser or because I wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn&amp;#39;t one. But I am. I can&amp;#39;t take back what I&amp;#39;ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I&amp;#39;ve learned this behavior and it&amp;#39;s voluntary, it&amp;#39;s totally within my control to change it. I&amp;#39;ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don&amp;#39;t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I&amp;#39;m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: Wow, just wow. I didn&amp;#39;t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \\nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read every single comment in &lt;a href=\"/r/bestoflegaladvice\"&gt;r/bestoflegaladvice&lt;/a&gt; even though I didn&amp;#39;t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I&amp;#39;m not sure why I did it, but I don&amp;#39;t think &amp;quot;congrats&amp;quot; is quite the right thing to say to me. I don&amp;#39;t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I&amp;#39;d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google &amp;quot;batterer intervention programs in my area.&amp;quot; I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don&amp;#39;t think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say &amp;quot;oh I&amp;#39;m perfect now so I can do what I want,&amp;quot; trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as &amp;quot;that creepy kid&amp;quot; at my new college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)\\n\\nI sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.\\n\\nThe place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.\\n\\nUntil they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.\\n\\nThey knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.\\n\\nThey got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.\\n\\nFrom there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.\\n\\nWhen I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.\\n\\nMy big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.\\n\\nThat's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. \",\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read my old post here: &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=legaladvice\"&gt;[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sadly don&amp;#39;t have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The place wasn&amp;#39;t like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don&amp;#39;t agree that you&amp;#39;re ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren&amp;#39;t convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I&amp;#39;m broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn&amp;#39;t care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She&amp;#39;d tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn&amp;#39;t ready.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn&amp;#39;t working anymore and told me that they&amp;#39;ve deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From there I didn&amp;#39;t care anymore and they were convinced they&amp;#39;ve achieved their goal. So things became easier. They&amp;#39;d teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children&amp;#39;s book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn&amp;#39;t deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn&amp;#39;t good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m the same person or not or how much I&amp;#39;ve changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn&amp;#39;t even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I&amp;#39;m 18 and I&amp;#39;m counting every single day until this is over and then I&amp;#39;m leaving with my brother and we&amp;#39;re never looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn&amp;#39;t access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn&amp;#39;t lose subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn&amp;#39;t afford to keep me there anymore that&amp;#39;s why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad.

       "   'selftext': 'Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\\\\_i\\\\_take\\\\_prescription\\\\_medication\\\\_for\\\\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)\\n\\nI am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.\\n\\nI met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don\\'t want to sue anyone if I don\\'t have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed\\n\\nUltimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn\\'t know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just \"suspended\" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being \"honest\" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don\\'t waste each other\\'s time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.\\n\\nI asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn\\'t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then \"maybe\" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.\\n\\nAnyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.\\n\\nWhen I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.\\n\\nHe told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.\\n\\nSo now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I\\'m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it\\'s not as \"intense\" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn\\'t give me the \"crash\" that Adderall does when wearing off.

I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.\\n\\nThe bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. \\n\\nThank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. \",\n",

I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don&amp;#39;t even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don&amp;#39;t have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don&amp;#39;t know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won&amp;#39;t fight back since my health was very poor at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that, I&amp;#39;m dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it&amp;#39;s now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I&amp;#39;m happy with the life I&amp;#39;ve lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. \\n\\nI went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.\\n\\nI did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.\\n\\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\\n\\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\\n\\nIf it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. \\n\\nI feel good for following all the advice here.\\n\\n\",\n",
